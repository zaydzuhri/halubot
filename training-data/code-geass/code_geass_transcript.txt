Lelouch: I swear… I swear, Suzaku, so help me. I will one day obliterate Britannia!

Britannian Police1: This is Alpha-3! Target is traveling from Delta-12 toward Delta-14, at a speed of 80 kph(kilometers per hour)!

Britannian Police2: CCP to all mobile units. Declaring a Code 3 from floor 5 to floor 2.
All units, take 2-8-8. I want the target intact!

TV: Here’s video footage of yesterday’s terrorist bombings in Osaka
The secretary reported 59 casualties in this incident: 8 Britannians, and 51 others …

Man1: You’re out of time. From here on you’ll make your moves every 20 seconds.

Man2: Very well, I’m game. Hm? Did your substitute arrive?

Man3: Thank heaven! I’m saved! Are things going well at school?

Man2: What have we here, schoolboys?

Lelouch: Hmpf. Well, look at this, a nobleman.

Man2: I envy you kids today.
You have so much time on your hands. Time for regrets…
What’s your name?

Lelouch: Lelouch… Lamperouge.

Rivalz: Waoh! Now wait a minute! You can’t win this one. It’s impossible, right?

Lelouch: Rivalz, when do you think we would have to leave in order to make our next class?

Rivalz: Ah… 20 minutes if we bust our hump.

Lelouch: Then be sure that you drive safely on the way back.

Rivalz: Huh?

Lelouch: I’ll need 9 minutes. By the way, about yesterday?

Man3: Understood, sir. We’ll discuss it later.

Man2: 9 minutes? You only have 20 seconds per move.

Lelouch: Enough time.

Man2: Hm? You start with the king?

Milly: Where’s Lelouch?

Shirley: He went somewhere with Rivalz.

Milly: What! Maybe it’s poker this time?

Shirley: They seem to forget that they’re on the student council!
They’re off gambling for money!
Lulu may be smart, yet he wastes his brain on stupid things!
If only he’d apply himself in school, he’d get high grades!

Milly: “Oh, I wish my darling Lulu would be a serious young man!”
How adorable is that?

Shirley: Please, madam president…

Nagata: Perfect!
After we finally steal this damn thing…!
It’s all because Tamaki couldn’t stick to Naoto’s plan.
And now we’ve got a problem!

Rivalz: I love playing against the nobility!
When they lose they always pay out of pride.
By the way, 8 minutes 32 seconds is a new record!

Lelouch: He also didn’t have much time to move, either.
And as opponents go, the nobles are tepid.
They’re just overprivileged parasites, that’s all.

Rivalz: Well then, why don’t you challenge one of the Elevens?
They’re nothing like us Britannians…

Man: What are they trying to prove by killing innocent people?

Woman: Those Elevens terrify me!

TV: We apologize for the delay.
Now His Royal Highness Prince Clovis, third prince of Britannia, will address the nation.

Clovis: To all my imperial subjects! Including of course the many cooperative Elevens who choose to serve the empire of Britannia!

Kallen: We’re not Elevens! We’re Japanese!

Clovis: Do you not see my pain?
My heart was ripped from my chest only to be torn apart!
The remnants are filled with rage and sadness!
However, as ruler of Area 11, I will not tolerate terrorism of any kind!
Because the battle we fight is a righteous one, a virtuous battle to protect the well-being of one and all!
Now then, everyone! I would like you to join me in observance of the eight who died for justice, in the line of duty.

TV: A moment of silence, please.

Rivalz: Well, aren’t you gonna join in?

Lelouch: Aren’t you?

Rivalz: Heh… It’s sort of embarrassing.

Lelouch: And I agree with you.
Besides, spilling tears over those people won’t bring them back to life now, will it.

Rivalz: Dang! That’s dark, buddy.

Lelouch: It’s all about self satisfaction.
Doesn’t matter how hard you try, you can’t do it.
There’s no way you can change the world.

Woman: You were magnificent, Your Highness!
One would never guess that you were attending a party while doing that!

Clovis: After all, the viceroy is the marquee actor of Area 11.
I need to change costumes quickly.

Woman: My! You’re so self-confident!

Clovis: It’s all in the performance. Since the media want a charismatic prince, I give them one.

Man: Untrue! Prince Clovis, our key purpose in life is to support and assist your reign in any way we can!

Diethard: His reign is a pathetic sham…

Bartley: Y-Your Highness!

Diethard: Hmm? A soldier?

Clovis: Gad, how boorish of you!

Bartley: I beg your pardon, Your Highness. My Lord…

Diethard: Not another appearance for him! Hope it’s not as dreary…

Clovis: You fool!

Bartley: The police were informed that it’s medical equipment, that’s all.
If we scramble the army there’ll be a record…

Clovis: Deploy the Royal Guard! The Knightmares as well!

Britannian Army: Alert 1! Alert 1!
4th, 7th, and 8th rapid reaction companies, as well as the 31st air assault Team, immediate scramble!
Special Division 9, stand by for deployment!

Rivalz: That first move you made…

Lelouch: Hm?

Rivalz: Why’d you start with the king?

Lelouch: If the king doesn’t lead, how can he expect his subordinates to follow?

Rivalz: What’s with that?

Lelouch: With what?

Rivalz: Do you fantasize about running a major corporation?

Lelouch: No way. Ambitions like that will ruin your health…

Rivalz: Whoa! We’re gonna die!

Nagata: You idiot! Watch where you’re going!

Kallen: No! Not that way!

Rivalz: Uh… Was that our fault?

Lelouch: I don’t think so–

Britannian Police1: Control, the target has crashed at the abandoned V.O. building construction site.

Britannian Police2: The military will take over. General Bartley’s command.

Britannian Police3: Him?!

Bartley: We have to retrieve it at all costs! That thing… in the wrong hands…!

Lelouch: What the…?

Rivalz: Oh man, this sucks! Looks like the power line on the bike got cut.

Lelouch: Yeah… Rivalz, come check this out.

Man1: Hey! Over here!

Man2: Woah! Nasty crash!

Woman1: What happened? Some sort of accident?

Man3: Probably a drunk driver…

Woman2: It’s always some moron…

Man4: Hey, maybe somebody ought to go help?

Lelouch: All those idiots…!

Rivalz: Wait!

Girl1: What is it, an accident? Did a car crash?

Man5: Look, the student rescue team has arrived.

Girl2: Oh wow, I totally missed it.

Woman3: So like, why doesn’t somebody call for help, you know?

Lelouch: Hey! Are you alright?

Rivalz: Yeah, yeah, I know it’s the right thing to do, but I wish the guy would quit flaunting his pride and just give it a rest for a while.
Now we’re gonna be late to school!

Kallen: Nagata? Nagata!

Lelouch: Can you hear me? Are you okay?!

C.C.: It’s you… Finally I have found my…

Lelouch: Where…? Are you in there?

Lelouch: Stop! I’m in here!

Rivalz: So, would you call that a hit and run?

Lelouch: You’d think they’d stick a ladder on the inside, too.

Britannian Army: Stop the vehicle!
Surrender now and you’ll get the chance to defend yourself in court!
Stop and surrender at once! Give up now or we’ll shoot to kill!

Nagata: Now what do we do?! That’s the army!

Kallen: Have you forgotten? That’s what I’m here for!

Lelouch: If I jump out, I have the choice of breaking my neck or getting shot. I can try to call–

Kallen: Can you enter the subway via the Azabu root?

Nagata: Kallen! Let’s use it here! Why not?

Kallen: Because that would mean a blood bath!

Nagata: You’re right.

Lelouch: I’ve seen her before.

Rivalz: Lelouch, come on! Where are you? We’ve gotta get to schoool!

Britannian Army1: Target is moving from the settlement toward the ghetto.

Britannian Army2: Copy that! Corner ’em!

Britannian Army1: Roger!

Britannian Army3: A Slash Harken?! A Knightmare!

Lelouch: Crap! These guys are real terrorists!

Kallen: You fellas know full well what this badass mother can do!

Jeremiah: The rest of you, back off. I’ll take this guy.
I can only assume you dug that obsolete relic out of some scrap heap.
An over the hill Glasgow is no match for a Sutherland!
Not to mention a filthy Eleven who spurns the compassion of our glorious Emperor!

Nagata: Kallen, we should both split up! Both of us can’t risk being killed! Run for it!

Kallen: But…!

Villetta: Simpleminded Eleven.

Kallen: No way?! It’s stuck…!

Jeremiah: Secondhand junk!
I will admit! I really like your spirit. However…!

Lelouch: No cell phone reception. We’re out of range.
Judging from the darkness and road surface, we must be driving along the old subway lines. They’re heading for an exit somewhere in the ghetto.
Getting out would be dangerous.
Still… Okay, I’ve got it.
I’m not big on military but I’ll take their protection.
If I give them a terrorist communicator…
Oh, wait. I forgot…

Rivalz: Some friend… Leaving me behind like that!

Lloyd: Ah-ha!

Bartley: What are you doing?!

Lloyd: Looking at a man who blundered… Am I right?

Bartley: Why, you…!

Lloyd: You really screwed this one up.
Terrorists came along and stole whatever it was that you and Prince Clovis were secretly working on.
Retrieving it is simple, but you want to sweep up all of their compatriots in addition.
Let the terrorists go and you can find their hideout, too.
Congratulations! Your reasoning was spot on!

Cecile: It was nothing. I just thought it was strange…
Bartley: Okay, that’s enough.
What is it the Special Corps wants out of this?

Lloyd: I’m merely saying that I’d like to assist with the cleanup!

Bartley: To assist?

Lloyd: Correct. Because it’s data I want.

Cecile: Excuse me, but what in the world have they just stolen, anyway?

Bartley: Chemical weapons. In other words… Poison gas.

Royal Guard: The terrorists are hiding in the subway system.
Your mission is to locate the weapon that they’ve stolen.
Investigate the old subway system that runs through the Eleven residential district in the Shinjuku Ghetto.
Report in the moment you spot them. Recovery of the target will be handled by us, the Royal Guard.
You people bear the honorary title of Britannians now, but you were born Elevens!
Therefore the stench of these monkeys oughta be a familiar one!
If you want to earn the right to carry arms, then show some results!
This is your opportunity to show your loyalty to Britannia!

Britannian Army: Yes, my lord!

Lelouch: An accident?! Or else…

Nagata: The tire’s stuck… Please, Ohgi… Find me…!

Britannian Army: 4-0-4 has sighted the target.

Royal Guard: Roger. Prepare for recovery.

Lelouch: Now I can use this chance to climb up…
Are you Britannian…?

Suzaku: That’s enough mindless murder!

Lelouch: Wait! I’m not one of…!

Suzaku: Planning to use poison gas! Don’t play dumb with me!

Lelouch: Get off me…!
I’m not here by choice. And if that’s poison gas, it was made in Britannia, wasn’t it?!

Suzaku: My god…!

Lelouch: Mindless murder?! Then why don’t you just obliterate Britannia!

Suzaku: Lelouch? It’s me, Suzaku.

Lelouch: You… you became a Britannian soldier?

Suzaku: Yeah. And what about you? You’re a…

Lelouch: What are you saying?!

Suzaku: That’s not poison gas…? What is it?!

Kallen: In all the confusion, I left it in the coat.

Ohgi: It’s okay. The Glassgow’s circuits are usable. So, were we right?

Kallen: Think so. I bet it’s poison gas, like Intelligence said.

Ohgi: And Nagata?

Kallen: I don’t know. I think he made it underground.

Lelouch: Tell me the truth, Suzaku.
Poison gas? This girl?

Suzaku: Hey, it’s what they told us in the briefing. I swear!

Royal Guard: Stinking monkey!
Being an honorary Britannian will not excuse you!

Suzaku: But sir, I was told this was poison gas!

Royal Guard: How dare you question orders!

Lelouch: This is bad.
A poisonous situation which would pose a threat to Suzaku’s superiors if it’s unleashed.

Royal Guard: However, in light of your outstanding military achievements I’m going to be lenient. Private Kururugi, take this and execute the terrorist.

Suzaku: But he’s not a terrorist!
He’s a civilian who got caught up in all this!

Royal Guard: You insubordinate little…!
That’s an order. Didn’t you swear your loyalty and your life to Britannia?!

Suzaku: Yes, but… but I can’t.

Royal Guard: What?

Suzaku: I won’t do it, sir. I won’t shoot a civilian. I can’t follow your orders, sir.

Royal Guard: Very well.

Lelouch: Suzaku!

Royal Guard: Well, Britannian schoolboy, not a good day to cut class.
Collect the girl. After you’ve secured her, kill the student!

Britannian Army: Yes, my lord!

Nagata: Death to… Britannia… Long live Japan!

Bartley: They got away?! And you call yourselves the Royal Guard?!

Royal Guard: Forgive me, my lord! The blast was mainly directed upwards, but the–

Bartley: Why the hell do you think I only told you people about this?!

Royal Guard: W- We’ll continue the investigation!

Clovis: The plan has moved forward to the next phase.

Bartley: But, but Your Highness…!

Clovis: If knowledge of her gets out, I’ll be disinherited.
Tell them back home we’re carrying out a planned urban renewal here.
As Clovis, third prince of the empire, I command you!
Destroy Shinjuku Ghetto! Leave no one alive!

Man: Why are they doing this?!

Woman: Dear, let’s go!

Man: Hurry!

Britannian Army1: Okay, let’s sweep next floor.

Britannian Army2: The enemy is garbage that can never hope to become even honorary Britannians! Wipe out every last one of them!

Jeremiah: Naturally.

Britannian Army3: Supervisor Jeremiah, General Bartley requests that you take command of–

Jeremiah: Bartley has staff officers. I haven’t had this much fun on the front lines in ages!

Clovis: Hmph.

Lelouch: What the hell are you?!
This chaos is all your fault, isn’t it?!
Not only that, but Britannia has even killed Suzaku!

Lloyd: Not there?

Cecile: It looks like he’s gone to the front line.

Lloyd: Even though we brought the Lancelot here?

Cecile: Now what’ll we do?

Lloyd: We steamrolled our way in here, but we don’t have a devicer to use it.

Lelouch: Stay quiet. Wait here.

Royal Guard: Report.

Britannian Army: We found only Elevens here, sir.

Royal Guard: You’re sure of it? That exit comes out here?

Britannian Army: Yes, sir. It matches up with our map of the old city.

Shirley: Huh? That jerk! He hung up on me ! I can’t believe it!

Royal Guard: What an appropriate location for a terrorist to meet his end.

Lelouch: You scum…!

Royal Guard: Still, you did well for a student, but that’s to be expected.
You’re a Britannian.
Unfortunately, my clever young friend, you have no future.

C.C.: He mustn’t die!

Lelouch: You shot her!

Royal Guard: Our orders were to bring her back alive if possible.
Oh well, nothing can be done about it now.
We’ll tell our superiors that the Royal Guard found the terrorist hideout and killed them all. Regrettably the female hostage had already been tortured to death.
What do you think, schoolboy?

Lelouch: How can this be happening?
First Suzaku’s killed… And this girl…
Now, I’m about to die.
Before I’ve had a chance to do a single thing with my life.
It’s gone in a heartbeat… Nunnally…!

C.C.: You don’t want it to end here, do you?

Lelouch: What…?

C.C.: You appear to have a reason for living.

Lelouch: The girl? That’s impossible!

C.C.: If I grant you power, could you go on?
I propose a deal. In exchange for this power you must agree to make my one wish come true.
Accept this contract and you accept its conditions, while living in the world of humans, you will live unlike any other.
A different providence, a different time, a different life.
The power of the king will condemn you to a life of solitude.
Are you prepared for this?

Charles: A convergence with the Ragnarok connection?
So the myth is beginning once again?

Lelouch: Yes! I hereby accept the terms of your contract!
Say…how should a Britannian who detests his own country live his life?

Royal Guard: Are you some kind of radical?

Lelouch: What’s wrong? Why not shoot?
Your opponent is just a schoolboy. Or have you finally realized?
The only ones who should kill are those who are prepared to be killed.

Royal Guard: What’s happening here…?!

Lelouch: I, Lelouch vi Britannia, command you…now all of you…die!

Royal Guard: Happily, Your Highness! Fire!

Lelouch: That was the turning point.
Since that day, I’ve lived a lie. The lie of living. My name too was a lie. My personal history, a lie. Nothing but lies.
I was sick to death of a world that couldn’t be changed.
But even in my lies, I refused to give up in despair.
But now this incredible power… it’s mine…
Well, then…

Lelouch: I don’t understand what it is you wanted me to do.
Why did you give me this bizarre power?

Villetta: How could all these Royal Guards be dead?
What happened here, boy?
And why is a Britannian student in a place like this?!
Are you deaf? Answer me or I’ll-
Answer me!

Lelouch: I order you to come out.
At once!

Villetta: Who the hell do you think you are to order me?

Lelouch: I see. It only works with direct eye contact.
My name is Allen Spacer, my father’s a duke.

Villetta: Nobility?

Lelouch: My ID card’s in my breast pocket.
After you confirm who I am, I’ll request your protection.

Villetta: Keep your hands up in the air, I’ll take out your ID.

Lelouch: Now then, hand your Knightmare over to me.

Villetta: Understood. The code number is XG21G2D4.

Lelouch: Got it.

Villetta: What the–

Lloyd: So are we having a bad day?
Looks like you missed a chance to go to heaven, Private Kururugi.

Suzaku: I did?
Where?

Lloyd: Hmm?
Ah, we’re still in the Shinjuku Ghetto.

Cecile: With Prince Clovis nearby this is probably the safest place anywhere.
This is what saved your life, Mr. Suzaku.

Lloyd: You’re lucky it was under your protective suit because that’s what deflected the bullet.

Cecile: Is it a keepsake?
Suzaku: Yeah, very.

Lloyd: You Elevens believe that gods live inside of everything, even objects, don’t you?
I guess this one–

Suzaku: Is Lelou-
What’s the latest on the situation?

Lloyd: It looks like the poison gas was released.
Massive Eleven casualties have been reported.

Cecile: They haven’t caught the perpetrators yet.

Suzaku: They haven’t, huh? Not yet?

Lloyd: Private Kururugi, how much experience do you have in piloting a Knightmare frame?

Suzaku: But there’s no way an Eleven would be made a knight.

Lloyd: Well, supposing you could?
Congratulations, the only Knightmare of its kind awaits you!
Once you take the controls of this big beauty everything will change, you and your world.

Cecile: Whether you want it to or not.

Kallen: Those damn Britannians!

Ogi: Kallen, can the Glasgow still move?

Kallen: Don’t worry Ogi, it’s all right. I’ll decoy them!
Get the people out of here.
The only ones that’ll be captured are those of us in the resistance.

Ogi: I know but we’re trapped, they’ve got us completely surrounded.

Students: That’s because you don’t have enough leg strength, right?
You’re wrong. You sink when you get fat.
Because you snack, right?
I’ll be fine, I burn up twice as many calories.

Shirley: Ah, Lelou?
What in the world have you been doing?
Where are you now?
If you keep cutting class, you’ll get held back.

Lelouch: Are you near a TV?
Shirley: A TV?
Lelouch: Sorry, but this is important.

Shirley: Hang on.
Hey, can I change the channel?

Student: Huh? To what?

Lelouch: The news, is there anything about Shinjuku?

Shirley: News? Uhh, let’s see…
There’s nothing on. Traffic restrictions?

Lelouch :Why is it restricted?

Shirley: I don’t know. They’re not saying.

Lelouch: I get it.
Once they finish everything off, they’ll release news that favors the military.

Shirley: Ooh, you’re gambling again, aren’t you?
I’ve warned you before more than once how dangerous that is!

Lelouch: Yep, you caught me.
By the way, tell my little sister that I’m gonna be late home tonight, would you?
Thanks.

Shirley: Oooh!
Why does he always hang up on me like that?!

Announcement: The number you have called is beyond service range.

Shirley: Oh darn it, not this again.

Lelouch: They need to keep a lid on this information, so it’ll be hard for them to call in reinforcements.
They’ll have to make do with the pieces they have on the board.
But I’m hemmed in here, and it’ll be tough to break through by myself.
Gaining refuge carries its own risk, too.
I want payback for being dragged into your fight.

Jeremiah :It’s our Glasgow friend.
Kallen :Just 30 minutes left!
Lelouch :The west entrance.
Use the tracks to move to the west entrance.
Kallen :Who’s this! How do you know this code?!
Lelouch :That doesn’t matter.
If you wanna win, you’re just gonna have to trust me.
Kallen :To win?
Okay, what am I supposed to do now?
Jeremiah :You pathetic Eleven.
If you simply run away, this hunt hasn’t much to offer in the way of sport.
Lelouch :Since you trusted me, you’re gonna win.
Jump onto the train!
Kallen :Gotcha!
Jeremiah :You think you can get through that way, hmm?
If that’s your plan, then…
You! Go after the Glasgow.
Military :Yes, My Lord!
Jeremiah :What the…?
Shot by friendly fire?
What’s your name and your unit?!
We’re after the one armed Glasgow.
Oh my god! A terrorist?!
Kallen :Aaaaah!
Jeremiah :You son of a–!
Kallen :You saved me.
But how did you get ahold of a Sutherland?
What? Where did he go?
Ogi :Kallen!
What the hell was that radio message earlier?
Kallen :What? He contacted you, too?
Ogi :Sure did.
And Yoshida’s group ought to be here soon.
Lelouch :Are you in charge?
Ogi :Ah, yeah.
Lelouch :I present to you the cargo in that train over there.
They’re tools for your victory.
If you want to use them to win, then follow my orders.
Resistance :There’s more in here!
Resistance :Here, too!
Resistance :Amazing! Maybe we should give this guy a chance.
Kallen :All this? But how?
Lelouch :Woman in the Glasgow!
Kallen :Y-yes!
Lelouch :Stay where you are.
Your unit’s gonna run decoy. You got that?
Kallen :Understood.
Lelouch :Energy filler status?
Kallen :About 15 minutes worth.
Lelouch :Then recharge it!
In 10 minutes, I’ll contact you with your next instructions.
This is wearing me out.
Regardless, I’ll need determination to succeed.
After all, I’m betting my life in this game.

Bartley :The terrorists are mixed among the Eleven populous and they’re mounting a minor resistance against us.
But they pose little threat to our vastly superior army.
Clovis :We know that. Moving on.
Bartley :Understood, Your Highness.
The gas capsules will be–
Clovis :What the public thinks.
Bartley :Yes. We’ll keep searching for her.
Clovis :Either way I want her captured dead or alive.

Tamaki :Hey, are you certain about this whole thing?
They’ve all had their IFFs removed.
What if this is a trap?
Ogi :The other side has total advantage in this war. They don’t need to set any traps.
All right people, let’s move. Get to your assigned points.
Lelouch :P1, can you move?
It operates basically the same as what you’re used to.
Ogi :Can’t you tell us who you are, at least your name?
Lelouch :I can’t do that.
What if these signals are being intercepted?
Anyway, if Q1 is on schedule, enemy Sutherlands, probably two of them, will reach you in 23 seconds.
Shoot them through the wall.
Tamaki :Aaarrrg, he’s out of his mind.
Ogi :Everyone, double check your weapons.
Tamaki :What?! Are you serious?

Military :Enemy spotted at point F 31.
Clovis :A feint, eh? How pedestrian.
Bartley :Tell Laslo’s squad to go straight in.
Have Eugen and Valerie strike from the rear.

Ogi :3, 2, 1 , fire!

Military :Sir Eugen and Sir Valerie, both lost.
Clovis :Hmm? An ambush?

Lelouch :An ID signal can be a double edged sword.
Besides, if the terrorists follow the orders I issue, my task at hand is sure to be completed.
P1, P4, P7, move a hundred meter to the right and fire your slash harkens toward 3 o’clock.
Ogi :You heard him.
Do what the voice says.
Tamaki :Damn, what else does he want us to do?
Lelouch :P5, ready?
Tamaki :Yeah. Quit calling me that.

Military :Ah! They’re using the same–

Military :The enemy’s moving towards G 28.
Bartley :Send Laslo’s Squad, I mean [Glaubey]’s Squad!
Clovis :This means terrorists have our military weaponry?
Military :Sir [Glaubey] has ejected!
His unit’s been lost!
Bartley :Change our codes, they’re intercepting our transmission.
Military :We already have sir, four times!
Bartley :Do it again.
Clovis :This failure is unacceptable.
Bartley :…Forgive me.
Lloyd :Good afternoon.
Bartley :What is it?
We’re in the middle of an operation.
Lloyd :I’d say it’s time to deploy the [ASEEC’s] special weapon.
Clovis :We’ve no time for this right now.
Lelouch :R2, fire anchor.
B7, use UN ordnance.
N group, you’ll continue your advance.

Military :You bloody Eleven!
Military :We just lost Laslo’s Squad.
Clovis :So do it.
We’ll have to bring up Quincey’s squad.
Bartley :My Lord, that will break the encirclement.
Lelouch :Now then, the enemy has five options. Their move.
Clovis :Reinforce the breach with some of the units guarding me.
All we know for certain is that enemy forces are here.
Jeremiah :Who ordered them to break formation?
Lelouch :Well that’s a more stupid move than I expected.
You, Q1, do you have an area map?
Kallen :Yes, I have a map of the old town.
But it has no current land marks.
Lelouch :It’ll do.

Clovis :All right, send in Burts and the others too.

Lelouch :Mission number 3 now.

Clovis :Concentrate our forces there. Surround them.

Lelouch :Is everything prepared?

Clovis :The enemy’s main force is that center dot.
Finish every one of them off.

Lelouch :Hm.

Clovis :What?! Where’s the enemy?

Lelouch :With this, I call check.

Lelouch :HAHAHAHAHA!
My plan worked, didn’t it.
I can do it. I can. I can defeat Britannia!
Clovis :Who? Who in the hell am I up against?
What if he’s even better than Todo?
Lloyd!
Lloyd :Yes, Your Highness.
Clovis :Can it win, will your toy beat them?
Lloyd :My Lord, please be so kind as to call it Lancelot.

Z-01 Lancelot now activating. Lancelot activating. Releasing hatch.
Z-01 Lancelot standby for activation. Pallet extension initiating.
Cecile :Did you read the manual?
Suzaku :Pretty much.
Cecile :Well done.
You scored at the top of the class in the simulator.
Suzaku :Hey, look.
About what you told me earlier.
Cecile :Huh? Ah, it could be.
But the possibility is nearly zero.
Suzaku :But that means there’s still a chance, right?
Cecile :Yes, I’m afraid that’s true.
Even so, you’re not to do anything reckless.
The new system is not outfitted with an ejection mechanism.
Suzaku :OK. I understand, Miss Cecile.
That’s it?
Cecile :Yes, the advanced weapon developed by us in the Advanced Special Envoy Engineering Corps, Lancelot, the world’s first seventh generation Knightmare Frame.
Lloyd :Well, if you’re ready, Suzaku, shall we proceed with the initial startup?
Cecile :Initial startup. Now percieving from phase twenty.
Equiping energy filler.
Confirm pre-start. Energy filler now at full output. 30 seconds to reach critical voltage.
Core Luminance, shifting phase.

Cecile :Initiating devicer setup.
Confirming entry of devicer into Z-01.
Individual ID registration confirmed.
Confirm man-machine interface. Engage.
Yggdrasil Resonance comfirmed.
Rejection Responce, weak. Devicer’s Stress Responce, weak. All readings, nominal…
Lloyd :So far, it’s going per the data.
…status, all green. Status of back up tactical bank, authorized. Secondary confirmation, given.
Suzaku :Lancelot, activate ME-boost.
Cecile :Lancelot, launch!

Lloyd :HAHAHAHA!
Running full throttle right out of the gate.

Suzaku :Cooler than the manual.
With this…!

Tamaki :Huh? What is that?
It doesn’t look like a Sutherland.
Lelouch :Hahaha… Another push and the check point will fall.
Resistance :This is B group, reporting enemy presence.
Lelouch :Hm? Reinforcements?
Real battle is different, isn’t it?
Status?
Resistance :Every one ejected, but they took out four units in nothing flat.
Lelouch :Enemy numbers?
Resistance :Just one. I think it’s a new model.
I’ve never seen anything like it- Ah!
Lelouch :What’s happening out there?
Resistance :Bastard!
Lelouch :What? It reflects bullets?
Resistance :Arrh, what do we do?
Ishida! Ah!
Lelouch :Useless so called terrorists.
With all the resources they have, they’re being beaten by one unit.
Resistance :Damn it!
Suzaku :Yes, I can do this. With Lancelot I can stop all this at once.
Lelouch :N4, N5, hold there.
When the rear units arrive, surround that thing.
Resistance :Gotcha.
We can’t stop it!
Lelouch :N units, what is it?
What happened?
Something I didn’t foresee?
Clovis :For heaven’s sake. Now I’ll owe my older brother a debt I don’t need to incur.
It’s for the best, though.
Ougi :Ah!
Lelouch :P1! Report!
The enermy, can it really be only one unit?

Cecile :These readings are even higher than predicted.
Lloyd :It’s because our pilot is taking his job very seriously.
Suzaku : If I can stop all the Knightmares, then this battle is over.
No matter what it takes, I’ve gotta save Lelouch and that girl.
Lelouch :You mean this thing’s what’s ruining my plan?
Suzaku :Are you the guy that’s in command?
Lelouch :Nothing more than a pilot.
How dare he!
No choice, I’ve gotta get out of here.

Kallen :Hey, I’m returning the favor.
I can’t–
Lelouch :I must remember that the most vital element in battle is the human one.

That damn monster’s unstoppable!
Suzaku :Bastard.
He’s tearing things up for no reason!
Woman :Eeeeeeeeek!

Lelouch :In the midst of battle he rescues someone?
Hm, I concede you the tactical victory here.
Nevertheless…
Lloyd :Huh? He saved someone?
Lab worker :Yes, so it would seem.
Lloyd :Hm… It’s very strange of him.

Woman :Ah!
Cecile :Suzaku, are you tired?
We’ll call it quits for today.
Suzaku :No. I’m fine.
Please let me keep going.

Lloyd :Be careful with his operational time!
Cecile :Yes, sir.
Lloyd :My, that boy’s an excellent piece of equipment.
Soldier :Stop there, your ID.
This is Prince Clovis’s personal transport.
Lelouch :At last, the check point. And barely guarded, per my plan.
Soldier :Your plan?
Lelouch :That’s right.
Now I’d like you to let me pass.
Soldier :Yes, sir.
Understood.
Ougi :Kallen!

Man :It’s your fault.
This is what happened when you oppose the Britannians.
Tamaki :What!? Why you gutless coward?
Woman :How many people were killed because of this!?
Tamaki :Shut up!
Do you know how many of us were killed or captured? Do ya?
Quit crying.

Kallen :Ougi, who was that voice we heard?
Ougi :Damned if I know.
He doesn’t answer when I call so maybe he b–

Tamaki :There, you see!
Instead of following somebody we don’t even know, we should’ve use the poison gas.
Ougi :But he–
Tamaki :Damn Nagata to hell!

Soldier :So this is where you Eleven vermin scurried off to.
Prepared to fire!

Kallen :Naoto!

Soldier :Commence–

Clovis :Attention all forces.
Cease fire at once.
Suzaku :Cease fire?
Clovis :I Clovis, third prince of Britannia and royal viceroy of Area Eleven, here by command you, all forces are ordered to cease fire at once.
You also cease destruction of any buildings or property. All casualties, whether Britannian or Eleven, shall be treated equally and without prejudice.
In the name of Clovis la Britannia, you are here by ordered, cease fire at once.
I shall allow no further fighting.
Clovis :Are you satisfied?
Lelouch :Very. Well done.
Clovis :And what shall we do now? Sing a few lively ballads, or perhaps a nice game of chess?
Lelouch :That has a familiar ring.
Clovis :Hmm?
Lelouch :Don’t you recall? The two of us used to play chess together as boys.
Of course, I would always win.
Clovis :What?
Lelouch :Remember?
At the Aries Villa?
Clovis :You, who are you?
Lelouch :It’s been a long time, big brother.
The eldest son of the late consort Marianne and seventeenth in line to the imperial throne, Lelouch vi Britannia, at your service.
Clovis :Lelouch?! B-But I thought–
Lelouch :That I was dead?
You were wrong.
I have returned, Your Highness.
And I’ve come back to change everything.

The date was August 10 in the year 2010 of the Imperial calendar.
The Holy Britannian empire had just declared war upon Japan.
Confronted by Britannia’s newest weapon, the formidable Knightmare frame, Japan fell to its enemy in less than a month.
The conquered nation was stripped of its freedom, rights, culture, and dignity.
Finaly, even its name was taken away.
11.
The name of Japan and its people was replaced with a mere number.

Britannian Army: Why the hell are we letting the Elevens go? What about the poison gas they’ve stolen?

Britannian Army: But it’s by order of Prince Clovis.

Britannian Army: What about Bartley? Get the general staff on the line.

Britannian Army: They’re not at their posts, sir.

Britannian Army: Are you telling me Prince Clovis is alone on the con?

Clovis: I’m overjoyed, Lelouch.
They said you died when Japan was brought into the fold.
What a blessing to have you back.
We should depart for the homeland immediately.

Lelouch: So you can use me as a tool of diplomacy?
It seems you’ve forgotten why we were used as tools in the first place.
That’s right. It was because my mother was killed.
Mother held the title of knight of honor but was a commoner by birth. No doubt the other imperial consorts held her in contempt.
Even though you made it look like the work of terrorists, I’m no fool.
You people killed my mother.

Clovis: It wasn’t me. I swear to you it wasn’t.

Lelouch: Then tell me everything you know. The truth cannot be hidden from me any longer.
By whose hand was she slain?

Clovis: My brother second prince Schneizel and second princess Cornelia, they can tell you.

Lelouch: They were at the heart of this? That’s all that you know, isn’t it.

Clovis: I swear it wasn’t me. I had nothing to do with it.

Lelouch: I believe you. However–

Clovis: Please, you can’t! We may have different mothers but you and I are still blood.

Lelouch: You can’t change the world without getting your hands dirty.

Milly: Wake up Lelouch! I know you were sleeping. Your hands stopped moving.

Lelouch: Well, you don’t have to beat me up over it, do you?

Rivalz: Huh, serves you right for ditching me like that.

Shirley: That’s right. What was up with you yesterday?

Lelouch: Um well…

Milly: That’s enough, you guys. Let’s not get side tracked here.
If we don’t come up with a fix for the club activities budget, there won’t be money left for anything at all.

Nina: And if it comes to that point…

Rivalz: The equestrian club will be pissed. We don’t want ’em comin’ in here on horse back.

Milly: Rivalz, can’t you be a more serious student council member?

Shirley: You know, it would have been nice of you if you would have reminded us about this mess a day ago.

Rivalz: I would have to say a day later. Then we would have given up.

Lelouch: Good idea. We can still do that.

Milly: GUTS!!

Rivalz: Are you trying that guts spell again?

Milly: Yeah, I want you people to start putting your all into this.

Lelouch: I really don’t think that your magic’s gonna do a whole lot.

Shirley: Actually it’s got me going, Madam President.

Milly: Supple and willing, that’s what I like.

Shirley: I train hard in the gymnastics club.

Milly: That’s not what I was getting at. You’re a ten.

Shirley: Huh?

Milly: From what I’ve seen in the girls’ bathroom anyway, you’ve been filling out in all the right places, huh.

Rivalz: Heh, heh,

Shirley: What, what are you talking about, you perv?

Shirley: Geez, our president’s just a dirty old man on the inside. Sullying the meeting with her filthy mind.

Nina: Yeah well, that’s Millie for you.

Rivalz: Look on the bright side. We got the budget balanced, didn’t we?

Student: They used poison gas?

Student: Man, that’s freaky.

Student: Shinjuku’s only thirty minutes from here.

Student: Oh my god! I saw smoke rising over in Shinjuku, it must have been the gas.

Student: Are they saying anything else about it?

Shirley: Shinjuku?

Lelouch: I heard about it in real time from a friend. That’s why I called you yesterday.

Student: Hey, check out the footage of those dead Elevens.

Student: Oh! Don’t look at that!

Lelouch: This is strange. Why would they cover it up?
Ugh-

Lelouch: Are they hiding Clovis’s death to fend off anarchy?
But if that’s the case, when they finally do announce it…
Humph, I guess that I’m not as tough as I thought I was.

Jeremiah: That ex-civil servant is such a fool.

Villetta: So are you referring to Bartley?

Jeremiah: The killer has breached our heaviest security twice already.
This perfunctory inspection is a farce.

Villetta: Margrave Jeremiah, now that Prince Clovis is out of the way, we pure bloods can…

Jeremiah: Let me make that call. We still need to woo everyone over.

Student: Kallen! It’s been ages!

Student: Are you all right? Sophie’s been worried sick all this time.

Student: You’re okay though, right?

Kallen: Yeah, I just have to go easy for a little while.

Lelouch: Of course. That’s why she’s so familiar.

Kallen: Anyway, if I stay home any longer I’ll never catch up.

Rivalz: What’s up, buddy? See something you like? You’ve got a thing for her, don’t ya!

Lelouch: Just thinking this a rare event. She hasn’t been here at school since this whole term started.

Rivalz: Kallen Stadtfeld. They say she’s sick or somethin’, and she barely showed up at school last year either.
Still, her grades are at the top of the class.
And she’s a member of the Stadtfeld family, which means she’s well-bred and rolling in money.
Man, you sure know how to pick ’em.

Lelouch: It’s not like that.

Rivalz: Aah, you don’t have to hide it. A touch too sheltered though, if you ask me.

Student: Aaaaah! There’s a bee! A bee!

Student: Oh my God. Kallen, run!

Student: Hurry up and run!

Kallen: I don’t get it, why is a bee after me?
Hm? I wonder if there’s a hive nearby…
God, I hate this! I’m sick of acting like a freakin’ invalid!
Crap, he saw me…

Lelouch: There’s no question, it’s her.

Kallen: Can I help you or something?

Lelouch: I want answers.

Kallen: Of course.

Lelouch: Were you the one piloting the Glasgow in Shinjuku?

Kallen: Yes.

Lelouch: Why terrorism?

Kallen: Because I’m Japanese. Though technically I’m half Britannian.

Lelouch: Half blood? But why go so far?

Kallen: Um, did you want something?

Lelouch: No. I got what I wanted here.
Oh, wait. Just to be sure.
Don’t tell anyone about Shinjuku.

Kallen: What do you mean, about Shinjuku? Why would you say that?

Lelouch: Go back to class.

Kallen: As soon as I get an answer to my question, I will.

Lelouch: It’s not working? What’s going on here?

Shirley: Hey, Lulu! Kallen!
You know, it’s time to head over to the chem lab!
You’d better get a move on!

Lelouch: Oh crap, it’s my turn to set up for class!
It didn’t work? But…

Sayoko: Well, what shall we do? He may be late again this evening.

Nunnally: I’ll wait. He said that we’d have dinner together tonight.

Sayoko: There now. This one’s finished.

Nunnally: Ah, a bird?

Sayoko: Yes, it’s a crane.

Nunnally: Amazing! The Japanese are so skillful.

Sayoko: Lady Nunnally?

Lelouch: I’m sorry I’m so late.

Nunnally: Hi, Lelouch! Welcome home.

Sayoko: Yes, welcome home, my lord.

Lelouch: No place like it, Sayoko. Right, Nunnally?

Bartley: As you know full well, the project was a complete failure.
Therefore this research division is being gutted.

Staff: Wha…? Yes, but–!

Bartley: I’ve set up a place in Narita for you.
Move everything out there.
While we may have no memory of it, the fact is the other staff officiers and I left Prince Clovis on his own.
I’m gonna be called out on the carpet for this back at home.
When that happens, if His Majesty learns this experiment’s got on without his knowledge, I…

Staff: Understood, sir. We’ll start prepping immediately.

Nunnally: Miss Sayoko was just teaching me about the art of the origami.
Fold a piece of paper the correct way, you can make birds, boats, almost anything.

Lelouch: Easy there.
You don’t have to tell me everything all at once, you know?
It’s not like I’m going anywhere.

Nunnally: Yeah, you’re right. Thank you.

Lelouch: You’re very welcome.

Nunnally: I’m so happy, ’cause last night you scared me a little.

Lelouch: Did I? Sorry. I just have a lot on my mind, is all.

Nunnally: Hey, they say, if you fold a thousand of these cranes, your wish’ll come true.
So if there’s anything at all that you’ve been wishing for?

Lelouch: No, not really. What about you? Do you wish for anything?

Nunnally: I wish the world was a gentler place.

Lelouch: When the day finally comes that you can see again, I’m sure that it will be.

Nunnally: Really?

Lelouch: I promise.
The truth is there are very few paths our future can take.
The Ashford family is sheltering us for now, but how long can that last?
If our identity is exposed, even Rival, Shirley, and the others will abandon us.
We’ll end up political tools, or casualty of royal ambition.
I have to build a world where Nunnally can at least find happiness.

Nunnally: Sayoko taught me this the other day.
It’s called a Japanese promise.
Cross my heart, hope to die, eat a thousand needles, if I lie.
Pinky promise song.

Lelouch: Well that’s scary. I may have to eat a thousand needles someday.

Nunnally: That’s right.
So I’d better not catch you telling lies, okay?

Lelouch: Don’t you worry. I’ll never lie, I swear.
Not to you anyway.

Lelouch: This is the only weapon I have. And I don’t even know how to use it.

Teacher: Lelouch! Class will be starting in a minute, you know.

Lelouch: Oh, yes sir.
Um, sir? What are the topics going to be for the essays on your next exam?

Teacher: The humiliation of Edinborough, the transfer of the capital, and north and south war topics.

Lelouch: So, I haven’t lost the power, then.
Sir? What exactly are the topics going to be for the essays on your next exam?

Teacher: Right, very funny. Maybe you should try studying, huh? Just apply yourself, you’ll do fine.

Lelouch: Yes, sir!
As I suspected, I can only use it on a person once.

Ohgi: So, how’s campus life treating you?

Kallen: Stifling. I was stuck in history class yesterday.
Look, maybe I should just head back.

Ohgi: The army’s on a high alert right now.
Stay there, and let things cool off.

Kallen: I don’t know.
What about the voice on the radio?

Ohgi: Can’t go looking for a voice.
Besides, Naoto would be happy to see you back in school.
Forget about Shinjyuku for now. I’ll be in touch.

Kallen: Shinjyuku…I guess he’s right, but…

Lelouch: Don’t tell anyone about Shinjyuku.

Kallen: No, it couldn’t have been his voice.

Lelouch: The aristocracy was highly educated, with such an emphasis on edification and training, they produced a superior breed of ruler.
And secondly, they possessed heightened efficiency, since only a small number of the very best were carefully chosen from their ranks…

Kallen: It could be…no, I can’t remember well enough to be sure.

Lelouch: All I did was simply mention Shinjyuku, but…

Kallen: If he knows who I really am, then…

Lelouch: At the first opportunity…

Kallen: I need to take care of him.

Bartley: And the research center?

Britannian Army: Transferred to Narita last night.

Bartley: Right then. I pray you forgive me, Your Highness.

Shirley: Hey Lulu, you coming along?

Lelouch: Sorry, maybe some other time.

Student: Yeah, I thought so.

Student: You’ve gotta go straight home then, huh?

Student: What do you have, a curfew ?

Student: What’s up?

Lelouch: You think that you could spare a minute? I need to talk to you.

Kallen: Sure. I was wondering when you were gonna ask.

Jeremiah: I hope you can see how determined we are now.

Bartley: But I’ve already told you!

Jeremiah: That you don’t remember? Still cling to that ridiculous excuse?

Bartley: Just ask the others! They’ll testify that… !

Jeremiah: Ducking the blame? You’re pathetic! You shan’t remain at His Royal Highness’s side another minute!

Kallen: I didn’t even know this room existed.

Lelouch: It’s the club house for the student council. They built as a ballroom for various special occasions.

Kallen: And we won’t be disturbed inside here?

Lelouch: Yes, that’s correct.

Shirley: Here it is! I found it! Look! This is it, right?

Nina: What a relief you found our lab data.

Rivalz: Good. My ass is killing me.

Milly: Were you able to find it? I finished up on my end, shall we dig in?

Rivalz: Wow!

Shirley: Way to go, Milly!

Milly: You adore me, I know.

Lelouch: Um, what is all of this?

Milly: Lelouch, don’t you know?
I thought that’s why you brought her.
We’re inducting Kallen into the student council.
It was my grandfather’s idea, actually.

Lelouch: The principal’s?

Milly: He thought it best, with her poor health she’d have a harder time with regular club activities.
Oh, I’m Milly, the president of the council. Pleasure to meet you.

Kallen: Oh, thank you, the pleasure’s all mine.

Rivalz: I’m Rivalz, the secretary.
If there’s anything you need to help with, I’m your man.

Shirley: Hi, I’m Shirley. And I’m a member of the swim club. Welcome.

Nina: Hi there, my name’s Nina.

Kallen: It’s nice to meet all of you.

Nunnally: Shirley, I’m sorry but, do you think you could set these on the table for me?

Shirley: Oh, sure, thanks, Nunna.

Lelouch: Nunnally, what’re you doing here?

Milly: This is Lelouch’s sister.

Nunnally: I’m still in the middle school group, so I can’t be on the council yet.

Rivalz: That’s alright. You’re an honorary member in our book.

Nunnally: Hello there, it’s a pleasure to meet you, Kallen.

Kallen: Thank you. You as well.

Rivalz: Right. Shall we kick this off with a toast?

Shirley: Champagne?

Nina: Yeah, but we’re on the student coucil, we shouldn’t…

Rivalz: Uh, come on! < Just relax. >
Loosen up, you guys! < It’s sparkling cider. >

Shirley: No way. We’re gonna get in trouble! < You swear? Let me see that bottle. >

Nunnally: What’s going on?

Milly: Here, Nunnally.

Rivalz: Lelouch! Heads up!

Shirley: Ah…Ah…You aren’t getting well with it either, Lulu… < C’mon, Lelou! Let me see that bottle! >

Nunnally: What just happened?

Milly: We have clothes for her?

Shirley: Sayoko’s on it.

Kallen: This is why I hate Britanians.

Lelouch: It’s Lelouch. I’ve brought you a change of clothes.

Kallen: You can come in. I’ve drawn the curtain already.

Lelouch: Sorry about all this. I know they can be a little over the top.

Kallen: That’s okay. Nothing wrong with cutting loose every once in a while, you know?

Lelouch: These are some of my clothes. Hope that’s okay.

Kallen: It’s cool. Don’t worry about it.
That was fast. You went all the way to the boy’s dorm?

Lelouch: Actually, I live here.
It’d be pretty hard for my sister to live off in the dorms.
The principal of the school lets us stay here as a favor.

Kallen: I see…

Lelouch: Anyway…

Kallen: Hey, wait! Can you hand me that pouch over there?

Lelouch: Sure. …You really are a live-wire, aren’t you?

Kallen: Were you the one in Shinjyuku?

Lelouch: What do you mean?

Kallen: Don’t play dumb. You brought up Shinjyuku the other day… Why?

Lelouch: Why do you ask? Is there something wrong with Shinjyuku?

Kallen: Don’t answer my question with a question. Yes or no, that’s all I wanna hear out of you.

Lelouch: If I don’t answer it, someone will come. That okay?
Hello? Ashford Academy Student Council. No, this is…
Oh, it’s for you. He says he knows you.

Kallen: Hello?

Zero: Glad you still alive, Q1.

Kallen: Was I wrong?

Zero: 16:00, the day after tomorrow. The observation deck at Tokyo Tower. Come alone.

Kallen: Who are you? How did you arrange that cease-fire order?
Hey, don’t hang up!

Lelouch: Did you say cease-fire? Sounds like you keep dangerous company.

Kallen: Oh, um, that was…

Lelouch: Let me guess… You’re talking about a game? Something on-line?

Kallen: Yeah, you got me. ‘Cause, you know, I’ve been shut up in my house so long…

Lelouch: That’s what I was warning you about, when I told you not to bring up Shinjyuku before.
Seriously, some guys will try to show you footage of what happened that day and it’s pretty damn grim.
By the way, you know I can see you, right?
Um, I won’t tell anyone. Later.

Kallen: I was wrong…

Lelouch: The council doesn’t require much actual work, I guess.
Beyond occasional paperwork, we’ll sometimes plan school events.

Kallen: So you mean like the cultural festival?

Lelouch: Yep, like that, along with the cross-dressers’ ball, the absolute silence party and swim suit day.

Kallen: What’s up with that?

Lelouch: Blame our president. You’ll be spending a lot of time with her. Hope you’re ready.

Nunnally: Lelouch, it’s awful.

Lelouch: What is?

Milly: Prince Clovis has been found dead.

Rivalz: They’re saying he was killed.

Jeremiah: Prince Clovis has been taken from us.
He fought for peace and justice against all of the Elevens.
He died a martyr.
We must all bury our sorrow, and carry on his will.

TV: We interrupt this broadcast with breaking news.
The man suspected as the murderer has been captured.
According to this report, the suspect is an honorary Britanian.
Private Suzaku Kururugi, a former Eleven and honorary Britanian.
I repeat, Suzaku Kururugi arrested for murder.

Lelouch, a youth of Britannia, had been granted special abilities by a mysterious girl.
Geass, the power to command others to do absolutely anything.
And Lelouch is determined to use that power to bring the Britannian Empire to its knees.
To avenge his mother, and create a world where his younger sister Nunnally can find happiness.
All the while knowing at the end of his quest, the Britannian Emperor, his father, awaits.
Or at least, that was the hope Lelouch carried in his heart back then…

Jeremiah: Do you know anything about this weapon?
Suzaku Kururugi, it was the one used to rob Prince Clovis of his life.
The barrel striations leave no doubt, and we’ve done a little homework on you as well.
You’re the eldest child of Japan’s last acting prime minister, are you not?
Your motive here is clear.
Suzaku: You’re making a mistake.
I have never even laid eyes on that gun.

Jeremiah: We’ve found your fingerprints all over this weapon. You’re also suspected of murdering members of the Royal Guard.
Come clean now, and you’ll be judged as though you were born a Britannian, not some worthless Eleven.

Suzaku: You’re wrong! I’ve done nothing!

Nunnally: That was Suzaku they mentioned on the news, wasn’t it?
Lelouch: Yep, it looks like he’s still alive.
Nunnally: Yeah, it’s been ages. We haven’t seen him since the war ended. Even we…
Nunnally: And Lelouch?
Lelouch: What is it?
Nunnally: It wasn’t true what the news said, was it?
Lelouch: Of course not. Suzaku would never do anything like that. They’ve just made a mistake.
Nunnally: Yeah… must be.
Lelouch: Right. Well…
Good night, Nunnally.

Tamaki:
That’s why we should’ve issued freaking statement sooner.we could’ve taken credit for it.

Ohgi:
Naoto. I’m not cut out for this, I’m no leader.

Old Man:
Yes, everything is just as you requested. We have the best in the business working on it.
Once the slide system is in order, it’s all yours.
Once I’ve erased all of the evidence I should forget this ever happened, right?

Principal:
Truely this is bitterly painful incident for all, the viceroy of area 11, our beloved prince Clovis has been lost to us forever.
However, we can and will bear the weight of this tragedy, and from this darkest of hours draw strength.

Lloyd:
We’ve lost the most crucial part of the equation.

Cecile:
Can we do it without him?

Lloyd:
Don’t I wish. The other units never let go of a good pilot. And even if we got one, they never match his readings.
His operational efficiency clocked at 94 percent. Then you wanna replace him?

Cecile:
You should tell them that, perhaps they’ll let Suzaku go.

Lloyd:
He’s an honorary Britanian, they’d never listen.
Ever since general Bartley’s disgraced, the purebloods have the military and I am gripped.

Shirley:
The pureblood’s what?

Lelouch:
Well, from what I understand, they’re saying that only pureblood Britanians should be allowed to serve in the military.

Lloyd:
Their view is one of their own can never be a criminal.
But if the criminal is an Eleven, it pays the way for Margrave Jeremiah to shut down the practice of granting natives honorary status.

Cecile:
And what about Suzaku?

Lloyd:
He is fake so but decided.

Cecile:
Hmm.

Rivalz:
Hey Lelouch! You got anything going on later?
After all classes have been cancelled for the day, hawks have been asking for a rematch.

Shirley:
You are not gambling you guys!

Rivalz:
Come on. Don’t be such a stick in the mud.

Lelouch:
She’s right though. Maybe it’s time to quit.

Rivalz:
Huh?

Lelouch:
I found a better opponent actually.

Shirley:
You did? I don’t get it.

Rivalz:
You’ll cut me in on the action too, right?

Lelouch:
A-Hahaha. Better not. It’s not really up your alley.

Guide:
Britania’s resounding victory over Japan opened the unenlightened nation’s eyes to it’s true place in today’s world order.
Since then the empire and area 11 had walked hand in hand down the road to revival.

Kallen:
16 hundred hours at Tokyo tower. Why here of all places?

Sugiyama?:
It was Kururugi who contacted us wasn’t it?

Ohgi:
Hard to say.

Yoshida?:
Yeah, but he might have been arrested after his communication with Kallen.

Sugiyama?:
Then we are in danger here. We should go.

Announcement:
Attention please. Paging Miss Kallen Stadtfeld, Ashford Academy.
One of your personal effects has been turned in at the kiosk on the observation deck.
I repeat.

Woman at the counter:
Hi. I’m assuming that this phone is yours, ma’am.
Uhm, something wrong? It is yours isn’t it?

Kallen:
Ah, yeah thank you so much.

Ohgi:
Oh yeah, there’s no debating. Life is better here thanks to Prince Clovis.
I mean it’s all due to Britania that we can rebuild as quickly as we did.
I’m happy about that…

Kallen:
Zero?
Uhm… Hello?

Lelouch:
I want you to board the outbound train on loop line five. And bring your friends.

Kallen:
What?

Jeremiah: You handled His Highness’s memorial program very well, a little too weepy from my taste but…

Diethard: Yes, well the masses tend to like tear-jerker, your excellency.

Jeremiah: Spoken like a true TV-man. Still I have to acknowledge the finesse you’ve shown. You did well in the short time you had. One would almost think you were expecting His Highness to meet his untimely end.

Diethard: It’s quite common from memorial program to be set in advance for important people.

Jeremiah: Does that including me as well?

Diethard: Recent event may have bumped you up the list a bit your excellency.

Jeremiah: I wasn’t deemed important enough till now is that it? How forthright of you!

Diethard: I’m afraid so sir.

Jeremiah: Ever thought of enlisting? The army could use more men like you.

Diethard: I don’t think it would be a very good fit. Not really my cup of tea.

Jeremiah: You prefer the civil sector I take it. No matter, I have another favor to ask of you. Tomorrow night Suzaku Kururugi will be transfered to his court-martial.

Diethard: We should line the road with good patriotic Britannians.

Jeremiah: Excellent. You catch on quickly don’t you? Be sure the rabble can see his face.

Viletta: Lord Jeremiah, there are those among the Elevens who see private Kururugi as a hero. Some might very well make an attempt to free him.

Jeremiah: I’ll be there personally aboard my Sutherland. If anyone even thinks of causing trouble, they will be executed on the spot.

Announcer: Attention all passengers if you become aware of any suspicious items on board, please alert metro personnel by using the nearest inter-telephone.

Kallen: What now?

Lelouch: Face forward and look to your right. What do you see?

Kallen: The Britannian city. It was stolen away from us and built on our sacrifice.

Lelouch: And on the left?

Kallen: I see our city. Remnants of the desiccated city after the Britannian sucked it dry.

Lelouch: Good answer. Now make your way to the front of the train.

Announcer: The next stop is Okubo. Okubo is next. Those wishing to transfer to the Chuo-Soubu line should exit at the next stop. Okubo will be next. Once again. Those wishing to transfer to the Chuo-Soubu line should exit at the next stop.

Kallen: Was it you? On the phone?

Yoshida?: Wow… Do you think it’s a trap?

Kallen: Well, was that you in Shinjuku? Was that cease fire your doing?

Yoshida?: Hey, we’re talking to you.

Lelouch: What do you think of my tour at the settlement?

Ohgi: Your tour?

Yoshida?: Come-on, there is no way it was this joker.

Lelouch: I wanted you to fully grasp the two, the settlement and the ghetto.

Ohgi: Yeah, we know. There is a difference between us and them. A very harsh one. And that’s why we resist them.

Lelouch: You are wrong. Britannia will not fall to terrorism.

Ohgi: Fall?

Lelouch: It’s a little bit better than childish nuisance.

Yoshida?: What was that? You call us a bunch of kids?

Lelouch: You should know your enemy. It is not people, but Britannia itself. It is a war you must wage, but not on the innocent. Take up your sword! Fight for justice!

Kallen: Oh please. That’s all easy enough to say, isn’t it? Hiding behind that mask… why should we even trust you?

Yoshida?: She’s right! Lose the mask!

Ohgi: Right. Are you going to show us your face or not?

Lelouch: Very well, I’ll show you. But rather than my face, bear witness to my power. If I deliver to you the impossible, then I might have earned your trust.

: He killed the prince of Britannia. Suzaku Kururugi should be treated as a hero.

: Yeah, but he’s an honorary Britannian.

: Prime minister Kururugi was his father.

: So what? The bastard gave up Japan, and people don’t know that about him.

: The whole Shinjuku business was the work of Kouzuki’s group wasn’t it?

: Yes, sir. They’re being led by a man named Ohgi at present.

: Has Kururugi’s family said anything?

: No, sir. They broke contact with him once he joined the military.

: Tohdoh, what are your thoughts?

Tohdoh: We should not become involved in this public execution.

: That’s cowardly! You are Tohdoh, the miracle worker right?

Tohdoh: There is difference between miracles and foolhardiness.

Lloyd: Congratulations! Those two you asked me about weren’t on the list of casualties.

Suzaku: That’s good to hear..

Lloyd: Not much luck on your end though, you may be getting a trial, but no one is pulling for you certainly.

Suzaku: But the courts are where the truth comes to light.

Lloyd: I expect there’ll be more smoke and mirrors than anything. The truth is scarce of late.

Suzaku: If that’s how the world works, then so be it. I’ve no regret.

Announcer:
Any moment. Any moment now. It’s a sight to see.
The throngs’ lining the route.
All of them waiting on bated breath. Waiting for the accused murderer of Prince Clovis to pass by.
An honorary Britanian and a former Eleven Suzaku Kururugi.

Diethard:
Camera 5 is a little slow.
Talk to me, Charles, your team been deployed yet?
What? The studio? Let them wait. Nothing has been pushed back.
Everything is going according to plan. Here we go.

Announcer:
I, I can see them! They have the suspect! Suzaku Kururugi is headed this way!

Diethard:
Like clockwork. Huh, what a circus this is.
And I’m as corrupt as any of them.—-

Cecile:
This is insane. We know that Suzaku is innocent.

Lloyd:
The court deemed our testimony inadmissible. There is nothing we can do.

Cecile:
Yes, but…

Lloyd:
Is that altruism or humanitarianism?

Cecile:
This isn’t a time for a game of semantics!

Lloyd:
Not much else to do? We both know where this case is headed, don’t we?
We couldn’t reach him at the summit. All we can do is cut our losses, really.

Announcer:
Voices of scorn growing ever louder. Voices bearing testament to a people’s love of their prince.
Raining their judgement down on a terrorist.

Nunnally:
Suzaku!

Announcer:
Margrave Jeremiah, integral in settling this case, will be presiding over the trial as acting consul.

Tamaki:
No way the three of them can pull this off on their own.

Ohgi:
He told us. He said he’d make the impossible possible.
He gave us his word to save Suzaku Kururugi.

Lelouch:
Right. No need to turn back. The die is cast.—-

Officer:
Acting consul Jeremiah.

Jeremiah:
What is it?

Officer:
Vehicle approaching the main highway from third.
We just let it through as you instructed but…

Jeremiah:
Do you believe the target could be a terrorist’s vehicle?

Officer:
Well Sir, it’s Prince Clovis’ car.

Jeremiah:
The prince’s car? Well looks like we’ve got a comedian. Don’t worry about it.
Just let them through to us. All forces hold here!

Suzaku:
Ah?

Sugiyama?:
Hey, they stopped. They really did!

Tamaki:
Huh! It’s just a coincidence.

Yoshida?:
Yeah, but he said Jeremiah would try to hog all the limelight, make some sort of stand about it.

Tamaki:
COINCIDENCE!

Announcer:
This is not a scheduled stop. Could there have been some sort of accident?
This is site 5. There is a vehicle approaching them.

Jeremiah:
Huh.

Announcer:
It’s, it’s Prince Clovis’ personal transport!
And it’s heading straight for the cavalcade!

Ohgi:
What a… He’s coming straight at them. What is he planning?

Kallen:
Hope they can’t tell it’s fake.

Lelouch:
I see. Just you two then.

Ohgi:
I’m sorry. We just need a little more time. If more people understood what we…

Lelouch:
No, the two of you will do just fine.

Kallen:
Huh? Come on! That’s ridiculous! There will be too many of them!

Lelouch:
With your help, clearing the task at hand will be child’s play.
I’ll need this by tomorrow. All that matters is the exterior.

Jeremiah:
You dare desecrate His Highness’s transport?
Come out of there.
Huh?

Lelouch:
I am Zero.

Villetta:
Zero?

Announcer:
Who is this person?
This man calling himself Zero, standing before a full millitary convoy.

Rivalz:
What is all this?

Tamaki:
What the hell does he think he is doing?

Announcer:
Who is this man calling himself Zero?

Diethard:
Zero?
What do you mean, like ‘nothing’?

Announcer:
Are we gazing on a terrorist? Certainly not the wisest if such is the case.

Suzaku:
Is he an Eleven?

Lelouch:
Now to return the favor, Suzaku.

Jeremiah:
I’ve seen enough, Zero. This little show of yours is over.
First things first. Why don’t you lose that mask?
What in the…!?

Villetta:
Jeremiah, be careful, he’s got the…

Lelouch:
Yes, Jeremiah.
You never saw inside this thing.
So you assume it holds poison gas.

Suzaku:
Wait.
You don’t understand…

Announcer:
Can all of you watching at home see this? It’s some sort of device, although its purpose is unclear. Stay with us and we’ll see if this so-called terrorist has anything to say.

Jeremiah:
You bastard!
He’s taken every Britannian here hostage, and he’s done it without them even knowing it.

Lelouch:
You intend to shoot?
I think you know full well what will happen if you do.

Diethard:
Unit 6 bring up the sound and get that camera right in his face!

Staff:
Sir, it’s too “hairy” out here.

Diethard:
Damn, amatures!

Jeremiah:
Fine, what are your demands?

Lelouch:
An exchange. This, for Kururugi.

Jeremiah:
Like hell. He’s charged with high treason for murdering a prince.
I can’t hand him over.

Lelouch:
No.
You’re mistaken, Jeremiah.
He’s no murderer.
The man who killed Clovis was myself.

Cecile:
Unbelievable!

Lloyd:
The real culprit, hey.

Announcer:
What? What does this mean?
This masked man called Zero – no, we can’t be sure who he is – but in any case, he claims to be the real assassin?
So where does this leave the current suspect, Private Kururugi?

Ohgi:
Ah! Crap!
There is no way out of this.

Kallen:
We are so screwed.

Lelouch:
For a single Eleven, you’ll save scores of precious Britannians.
I find that to be a bargain.

Diethard:
This is all one big performance to him.

Jeremiah:
He is mad, I tell you. Disguising this truck as His Highness’! He’ll pay the price for mocking the crown!

Lelouch:
Careful.
You don’t wish the public to learn of Orange, do you?

Soldier:
Orange? What’s he talking about?

Soldier:
I don’t know.

Lelouch:
If I die, it’ll all go public. If you don’t want that to happen…

Jeremiah:
What are you talking about? What is this?

Lelouch:
You’ll do everything in your power to let us go, your prisoner as well.

Jeremiah:
Right, understood. You there, release the prisoner.

Kallen:
Eh!?

Villetta:
What on earth are you doing, My Lord?

Jeremiah:
Get that man over here.

Villetta:
Hah?

Soldier:
Should we? But …

Jeremiah:
Hand him over. Nobody gets in his way.

Kewell:
No. What are you thinking? You can’t do this!

Jeremiah:
Lord Kewell, this is an order.

Announcer:
It’s hard to tell what’s happening from here, but it seems that Kururugi’s release has been brokered!

Suzaku:
So, who the hell are you?

Lelouch:
As I thought, they didn’t allow you to speak.

Villetta:
If they get away, we’ll lose everything.

Kallen:
It’s time to go, Zero.

Lelouch:
Well then, tell next time.

Villetta:
You cowardly Eleven. Lord Jeremiah, what are you …?

Jeremiah:
You heard me! Stand down now!

Kewell:
They are not alone at all. They jumped right off.

Ohgi:
It works! Now we can…

Kewell:
You imbecile!? There’s nowhere for you to run!

Jeremiah:
Lord Kewell!

Kewell:
Huh!?

Jeremiah:
Are you going to follow orders or not? And believe me, there will be repercussions.
All units, do I make myself clear? Do everything in your power to help them get away.

Terrorist:
Man, I didn’t really think he could do it.

Terrorist:
Yeah, who is this guy?

Tamaki:
That’s crap! How many times can a bluff like that work, anyway?

Ohgi:
You gotta give the guy some credit though.

Tamaki:
Huh?

Ohgi:
Gotta admit it nobody else could’ve pulled that off. Not the Japanese Liberation Front, certainly not me.
We’ve always thought that a full-on war with Britannian wasn’t a possibility at all. But maybe with him, it is.

Lelouch:
It looks like they treated you rather roughly. Now you know what they’re really like, Private Kururugi.
Britannia is rotten. If you wish to bring change to this world, then join me.

Suzaku:
So, is it true? Are you really the one who killed Prince Clovis?

Lelouch:
This is war. Why wouldn’t I kill an enemy commander?

Suzaku:
And the gas? Those were civilians out there.

Lelouch:
A bluff to help things along. The result, not a single death.

Suzaku:
The result? That’s all that matters to you, I suppose. Huh…

Lelouch:
Come join me. The Britannia you serve is a worthless dominion.

Suzaku:
Maybe that’s true, but… but this nation, it can be changed for the better, and from within.

Lelouch:
Changed?

Suzaku:
And any ends gained through contemptible means aren’t worth anything.

Lelouch:
Wait. Where are you going?

Suzaku:
My court-martial begins in an hour.

Lelouch:
Damn, are you mad? The only reason they’re giving you a trial is to find you guilty.
The judge, the prosecution, and defense.

Suzaku:
Rules are rules. And if I don’t go, they’ll start cracking down on Elevens and honorary Britannians.

Lelouch:
But you’ll die.

Suzaku:
I don’t mind.

Lelouch:
Don’t be an idiot.

Suzaku:
An old friend of mine always used to tell me that. He’d say I was a fool. It’s my weakness, I guess.
I’d try to bring you in, but you’d just end up killing me.
And If I’m going to die, it’ll be in the service of the people.
Even so, I thank you… for saving me.

Lelouch:
You fool.

Announcer:
Yes, apparently. Private Kururugi has made contact with the authorities. It would seem the Zero has released him.
However now that the original charges against him have been thrown into question, it’s very possible Kururugi would be found innocent and acquitted.

Nunnally:
Thank goodness.

Announcer:
For legal perspective on all of this, we now turn to our legal analyst …

Nunnally:
Miss Sayoko?

Arabian Commander: Open fire!

Arabian soldier: Gloucester?

Arabian soldier: It’s supposed to be in Serupham.

Darlton: Shoddy oversized imitation Knightmares.

Guilford: They would’ve been wise to surrender from the start.

Arabian Commander: What?

Arabian Commander: So Cornelia. A single unit did this?

Cornelia: Another victory. Area 18 has been established.

Subordinate: My Lady, about our next course of action.

Cornelia: Sorry to have you clean up after my foolish younger brother.

Subordinate: Please don’t apologize, my Lady. We live to serve and our place is with you.

Cornelia: Humph. Do you think the Area 11 needs our usual treatment?

Subordinate: Yes, my Lady.

Cornelia: Good.

Cornelia: I’ll drive you into the open, Zero. Clovis will be avenged.

Lelouch: I’m back.

C.C. : Welcome home, Lelouch.

Nunnaly: I’m so glad. I was worried.

C.C. : I’m assuming you ate out tonight judging from your appearance.

Nunnaly: Thank goodness. I thought maybe you’ve gotten caught up in all the uproar caused by that man Zero. I tried calling you but you didn’t answer your cellphone. I wanted to tell you Ms. C.C.’s been waiting as well.

Lelouch: C.C.?

Nunnaly: Your friend goes by such an unusual name, only her initials.

Lelouch: Yeah.

Nunnaly: I was just wondering, is C.C. your girlfriend?

Lelouch: Huh?

C.C. : He made a promise about our future together. Right?

Lelouch: Huh?

Nunnaly: A future together? You mean marriage?

Lelouch: No! No, that isn’t what she was talking about. It’s like a… she’s kidding around.

C.C. : No, I’m not.

Nunnaly: Well you’re certainly doing this sooner than most. But everyone’s different, aren’t they? So I suppose it isn’t THAT strange. And if you feel like you’re ready for…

Nunnaly: Oh.

Lelouch: Oh, C.C. Look what you’ve done, you’re soaking wet. Come on, let’s get you to the bathroom and into a dry change of clothes.
Nunnaly, stay here and I’ll clean it up in a minute. And she was kidding before. Kidding. Just a dumb joke. That’s all.

Lelouch: Who are you?

C.C. : She said my name. I’m C.C.

Lelouch: That’s not I meant. Why aren’t you…

C.C. : Supposed to be dead?

Lelouch: Hmm…

C.C. : So, do you like the power that I gave you?

Lelouch: As I thought, it was you.

C.C. : Dissatisfied?

Lelouch: On the contrary, I’m grateful. It allows me speed up my schedule tremendously, which is a huge help.

C.C. : Your schedule?

Lelouch: Yes. My schedule for obliterating Britania. I would’ve had to wait much longer before I could’ve made the initial move.

C.C. : You believe you can destroy it simply by using that power?

Lelouch: I intended to do it without this power.

C.C. : I just knew that he’d turn out to be a fascinating guy.

Lelouch: But what’ll you do now? I’m sure the military is after you.

C.C. : Not the entire military, only a small faction of it. So it shouldn’t be difficult to find hiding place. I can make do here.

Lelouch: What? You expect to stay here?

C.C. : A gentleman would sleep on the floor.

Lelouch: Don’t joke around.

C.C. : My being caught would cause trouble for you too.

Lelouch: It’s dangerous to stay together.

C.C. : If I wander the streets, they’ll find me.

Lelouch: This isn’t about you. It’s my situation.

C.C. : I hate stubbornness.

Lelouch: You sure take things casually, don’t you? How did you manage to survive before this? What did you do before now? And what’s the deal with that so-called contract you spoke of…

C.C. : Good night, Lelouch.

Lelouch: Hmm…

Cecile: Fukushima, Kouchi, Hiroshima. This has been the seventh occurence since that man named Zero raised his head.

Lloyd: It seems the other groups are following his lead and putting up a valiant fight.

Cecile: And now, suspicions about that “Orange” thing have cost Margrave Jeremiah his command.

Lloyd: Maybe he wasn’t good enough. Thanks to him, connections between the police and the administration are screwed up. It’s made a fine mess for us as well.

Senba?: Help them Tohdoh! Zero has thrown the Britannians into chaos. Now is the time for us in the Japan Liberation Front to make our stand!

Tohdoh: Calm down. The information of Kyoto giving the Guren Mk-II to Zero hasn’t been confirmed. If we pay too much attention to Zero we may trip ourselves up.

C.C. : So, what did “Orange” turn out to be anyway?

Lelouch: Hunh.

C.C. : Well?

Lelouch: You know for someone who isn’t willing to answer any questions, you certainly do ask a lot of them.

C.C. : If you don’t want to answer my questions, you don’t have to. Just as I don’t.

Lelouch: Humph. There is no “Orange”. It’s something I made up. But, the more they claim to be comrades of like-mind, the easier it is to divide them with the thorns of suspicion.

C.C. : H’m.

C.C. : Everyone on earth is looking for you. Because of you the world is going through an upheaval. So, is this it? Is this what you wanted to see?

Lelouch: No. This uproar’s simply a means to an end. The world is destined to descended into a greater chaos.

Judge: Case No.107 Private Suzaku Kururugi, Area 11 Military Forces. In the murder of His Highness Prince Clovis you are no longer a suspect, and are hereby set free due to lack of evidence.

Suzaku: What happened? I’m free.

Euphemia: Out of the way, please. Look out below!

Euphemia: Oh!

Suzaku: Uh, are you all right?

Euphemia: I’m sorry. I wasn’t aware you were down here until I had leapt.

Suzaku: Well, don’t worry. I wasn’t expecting a girl to come falling out of the sky and into my arms, either.

Euphemia: Oh, my…

Suzaku: Huh? Is there something wrong?

Euphemia: Yes! There is something wrong.

Suzaku: Huh?

Euphemia: The truth is bad guys are chasing me. So considering the circumstances could you help me, please?

Pure Bloods member: We must get rid of this “Orange” character before Princess Cornelia assumes her new post.

Pure Bloods member: Now the loyalty of us Pure Bloods is being called into question.

Pure Bloods member: Are the reports we’ve been hearing true? Lord Jeremiah was bribed?

Pure Bloods member: Do you know what this “Orange” means?

Pure Bloods member: Ugh.

Pure Bloods member: In any case, Lord Jeremiah is definitely hiding something.

Pure Bloods member: Saying he can’t recall anything, Bartley offered the same excuse.

Villetta: Lord Jeremiah’s memory is muddled. Exactly like those of the men in Shinjuku whose Sutherlands were stolen. And…

Euphemia: We haven’t introduced ourselves yet, have we? My name is… Euphie.

Suzaku: Euphie?

Euphemia: Yes.

Suzaku: My name’s …

Euphemia: Don’t tell me.

Suzaku: Huh?

Euphemia: ‘Cause I already know it. You’re a celebrity, son of Prime Minister Genbu Kururugi, Private Suzaku Kururugi.

Suzaku: Humph. You lied before. There’s no one chasing you at all, right?

Euphemia: Meow!

Suzaku: What?

Euphemia: Meow meow. Aww, does the kitty’s paw hurt? Oh, meow meow meow!

Kitten: Meow? (Sniff-sniff) Meow!

Euphemia: Meow meow.

Euphemia: (Tittering)

Suzaku: H’m…huh.

Kitten: (Chomp!)

Suzaku: Aargh!

Euphemia: Oh, my…

Lloyd: We’re running late. I hope he’s still waiting for us.

Cecile: Considering the charge, did they really release him?

Lloyd: Yes. They had no evidence. I’m sure they put him through the third degree because of that Zero incident, uh-huh?

Lloyd: What? Why is he…

Cecile: Aha.

Sound truck: If you want to enjoy…

Euphemia: Do you have trouble with cats?

Suzaku: H’m. I like them fine. However…

Kitten: Grrr…

Suzaku: H’m. The attraction isn’t mutual.

Euphemia: I think an unrequited love is a mark of a kind person. Oh.

Suzaku: Oh.

Euphemia: The kitty ran away.

Suzaku: Oo. Euphie, why did you tell me that lie when we met?

Euphemia: Do you ask because you’re concerned about me?

Suzaku: Huh? Um… of course.

Euphemia: Good! Then you can accompany me some more.

Suzaku: Alright.

Euphemia: Come on. It’ll be fun.

Euphemia: You know, being here is just like being in Britania. I feel right at home.

Suzaku: Are you from the homeland?

Euphemia: Uh-huh. I was a student there up until last week.

Suzaku: Last week? So what’re you doing now? By student do you mean high school? You can go sightsee anytime, can’t you?

Euphemia: Heh-heh. You ask a lot of questions.

Suzaku: Ah, sorry.

Euphemia: Oh! No, I don’t mean it like that. You see… today is the last day of my vacation. I wanted to see as much of Area 11 as I could because I’d like to know what kinda place it is.

Suzaku: Well, you didn’t need me for that.

Euphemia: No, I’m glad I could see it with you.

Suzaku: Is that right?

Euphemia: Suzaku, would you mind taking me to one more place, please?

Suzaku: Your wish is my command, my Lady. Where to?

Euphemia: Take me to Shinjuku.

Suzaku: Uh,

Euphemia: Suzaku Kururugi, please escort me there.

Kallen: Lelouch?

Lelouch: Hm?

Kallen: Do you have a minute?

Lelouch: Uh-huh. What is it?

Kallen: About that phone call the other day.

Lelouch: A phone call?

Kallen: Yeah, you know, when you and I were in the bathroom.

Lelouch: Uh-huh.

Kallen: Can you find out what the caller ID was? I want to contact that person again.

Lelouch: It was a school phone, so I’m not sure such… EEK!?

Kallen: I see. Make sense. I should have known.

Lelouch: That girl…

Kallen: What? Is there something wrong…Woa?

Shirley: Huh? No way.

Kallen: Excuse me. What are you doing?

Lelouch: Ah… what indeed.

Bartley: To think I turn to homeland like this, I wish I never involved the damn girl.

Lelouch: Are you insane? You can’t go walking around.

C.C.: Don’t act strict with me, I never leave the school ground so it’s fine.

Lelouch: It’s not. You can’t do as you like here, you don’t belong.

C.C.: I don’t belong anywhere.
Hmm? What’s with her?

Lelouch: Oh, is she doing again today?

C.C.: Again?

Lelouch: She is going to be marking the wall like that every day, because I used my Geass on her to make her do it.

C.C.: Geass?

Lelouch: The name of the power I have. That’s what I heard when we first made contact.

C.C.: You testing how long it lasts?

Lelouch: I need to know the specs of my weapon, don’t I?
So behave or I’ll try it on you.

C.C.: Would it work on me?

C.C.: Oh relax, you and I are in this together, I won’t do anything to endanger us or our unique partnership.

Suzaku: The Shinjuku Ghetto… ruined again. The residents were starting to return too.

Britannian: Man, they didn’t use RG on the Elevens. I figured they wouldn’t.

Britannian: Hey, look! Those are marks of Hummer rounds. Get a clear shot of it.

Britannian: Say cheese! Got it. Okay, me next.

Jeremiah: This is accurate? This information about Zero?

Pure Bloods Operator: Yes, sir. Lord Kewell contacted me.

Jeremiah: Right. Set up a cordon around Shinjuku Ghetto Sector 4 at once.

Pure Bloods Operator: Cordon Sector 4. Roger. Okay, ball’s in your court now, Lord Kewell. Ugh!

Villetta: I wanted to be put through to Lord Jeremiah. But it appears that you’re too busy now.

Tamaki: Get out of here, you damn Britanian bastards!

Euphemia: Eh?

Suzaku: Stay here.

Britanian: How dare a lowly Eleven speak like…

Tamaki: Don’t call me Eleven! I’m Japanese.

Britanian: Wrong. You seem to forget you people lost. You’re nothing but a beaten dog!

Tamaki: Grrr… you racist pig.

Suzaku: Stop. Please no violence!

Tamaki: Stay out of this!

??? : You’re that…

??? : Are you Suzaku Kururugi?

??? : The guy who killed Clovis?

??? : No, it… it… it was Zero who killed him.

Tamaki: Tchick. This guy is nothing more than a slave. Big deal. You’re an honorary Britanian. Nobody cares. You sold your pride, your people, yourself, yet you call yourself Japanese?

Suzaku: No! You’re wrong!

Tamaki: I am not wrong! You stinking Britanian lapdog aaah…

Others: Ah.

Tamaki: Oh!

Suzaku: Stop, please!

Tamaki: (grunt)

Suzaku: I’ve warn you I’ve been trained for military combat. Don’t make me fight against my own people.

Tamaki: Like hell your own people!

Eleven: Come on. Just let it go.

Tamaki: Oof, lousy traitor.

Euphemia: Suzaku.

Euphemia: Oh, my… Are you okay?

Suzaku: Yeah, I’m alright.

Britanian: Well I’m not O.K. Just look at my prime-G and my elex-4.

Britanian: Why did you wait? Damn it, some honorary citizen you are.

Britanian: Why’d you let ’em go? You should have killed ’em. What’s a few dead elevens to a guy like you! Who do you think’s taking care of you all these years anyway? Ugh!

Euphemia: I’ll not allow you to insult this man any longer you oaf.

Lelouch: To use my Geass, I need to have direct eye contact with the subject. Transparent objects like eyeglasses present no problem. The effective range is approximately 270 meters. And a subject appears to have no memory of events before, during, or after the power is used. I think this is due to damage caused by the Geass interfering with the brain of the subject. Also if the signal’s optical I can reflect it.

C.C. : In the short time you had it, you’ve learned a lot.

Lelouch: My opponent is an Empire that controls more than 1/3 of the entire world. There’s no such thing as being too careful.

C.C. : I’d understand if you were an Eleven, but you are a Britannian, aren’t you? This opponent may be too large and strong to fight with only Geass for a weapon.

Lelouch: Is it good to be strong?

Suzaku: Is it bad to be weak?

Suzaku: Back then when I was ten, the world seemed like such a terribly sad place. A world without any hope at all.

Lelouch: Starvation,
Suzaku: disease,
Lelouch: filth, decay,
Suzaku: racism,
Lelouch: constant war and terrorism.
Suzaku: Living in a never-ending cycle of hate.
Lelouch: Rats running in a wheel.
Suzaku: The cycle must be broken. Somebody has to do it.

C.C. : How idealistic.

Suzaku: Of course, it’s doubtful if the one who does it will make all the bad things go away.

Lelouch: I’m not that arrogant, and so…

Suzaku: No one should lose more of the people they love. At least, a world without war.

C.C. : And to have this utopia you’d…?

Euphemia: How would you do it?

Lelouch: It’s simple. When somebody wins, the fighting will end.

C.C. : Somebody?

Suzaku: I don’t know how you would do it. But if I stop trying, then my father’s death will have been in vain.

Euphemia: The Prime Minister’s death?

Suzaku: My own father died, because he had to sacrifice his life in that war.

Euphemia: Ah.

Kewell: Jeremiah. You are going to pay for letting Prince Clovis’ murderer go free.

Jeremiah: Kewell! You dirty coward. That sighting of Zero was a lie, wasn’t it?

Kewell: We have to wipe away our disgrace before Princess Cornelia takes up her post here.

Kewell: This is how we keep our officials honest.

Cecile: Suzaku!

Suzaku: Miss Cecile.

Cecile: It’s dangerous here, get in.

Lloyd: The Pure Bloods are having a silly squabble. Let’s get out of here. Oh, and by the way, what a shame about your acquittal. Because now you’ll have to work for me again.

Suzaku: Wait, please! Isn’t this an opportunity to gather battle data for the Lancelot?

Cecile: Ah?

Lloyd: Oho?

Euphemia: Suzaku…

Suzaku: I’m sorry, Euphie. We have to say goodbye here. I need to do this. I think I can stop them with the Lancelot. I have to try. I… I must!

Jeremiah: Damn, it’s four against one. Cowards!

Kewell: Don’t worry Jeremiah. We’ll say you died in battle. Your family’s name won’t be disgraced.

Jeremiah: You’re serious then? You actually intend to kill me? Kewell!

Kewell: Silence, Orange! We serve the Imperial family. Why else would we be here? All Hail…

Pure Bloods: Britannia!

Kewell: What, ugh…

Suzaku: Stop it! You’re all Britannian soldiers!

Jeremiah: That’s him, it’s that Honorary Britannian. The advanced weapon, Lancelot.

Kewell: What business of the Special Corps want here? Interlopers will die.

Suzaku: No! I can’t stand by and ignore this senseless battle.

Kewell: Oh my God. They’ve perfected the MVSes. Too late, I won’t back down.

Suzaku: We’re on the same side!

Jeremiah: Suzaku Kururugi… is saving me?

Kewell: We can at least kill Orange.

Kewell & Jeremiah: Grrrr

Viletta: Lord Jeremiah!

Jeremiah: Viletta! Thanks.

Suzaku: Still wanna fight?

Kewell: Men, stand down.

Suzaku: You… you understand then?

Kewell: I’m using a chaos mine.

Suzaku: Huh?

Euphie: No, stop it now!

Suzaku: Ah.

Jeremiah: What?

Euphie: Ahh!

Suzaku: Nng, ahh

Euphie: Ah. Hmph.

Viletta: That Honorary Britannian. He risked his life for…

Euphie: Everyone, lower your weapons at once. In my name I command you.

Kewell: It…can’t be.

Euphie: I am Euphemia li Britannia of the Empire. And the third princess of the royal family.

Suzaku: Ah! Euphie.

Euphie: I’m assuming command here. Now fall back.

Jeremiah: It is her, it’s the princess.

Cecile: Did you know it was her, Lloyd?

Lloyd: Uh-huh, but she’s been a student up until now and hasn’t made her public debut yet.

Kewell: We, we’re truly…

Pure Bloods: We’re truly sorry, your Highness!

Suzaku: My Lady!

Euphie: Ah.

Suzaku: I had no idea who you were. Please forgive me, Princess.

Euphie: Suzaku, you and I bear a similar deep pain. You have lost your father as I have lost my brother.

Suzaku: Ah.

Euphie: Will you let me help you in your quest to ensure that no one ever again has to suffer the loss of a loved one on the battlefield.

Suzaku: Yes I’m unworthy of your kindness.

Cornelia: I heard what you did, Euphemia. You shouldn’t be so reckless.

Euphemia: I know, Sister. Forgive me. But…

Cornelia: You will address me as Viceroy here, Sub-Viceroy Euphemia. Because we’re sisters we need to follow a stricter protocol.

Euphemia: Yes, I understand.

Cornelia: Humph. Now then, give me your report.

Subordinate: Yes, my Lady. The first order of business is a welcome party we’ve arranged for your Highness and… Oh!

Euphemia: Ah.

Cornnelia: Sloppy, senile, corrupt. Where is Zero? I want the enemy of the Empire caught! Get Zero!

Lelouch: Huh?

Suzaku: I’ll be joining the student body here at Ashford Academy beginning today. My name is Suzaku Kururugi. It’s a pleasure to meet you.

Lelouch: Yes, I understand. I’m lying. To Shirley and Rivalz and the others. Even to Suzaku and Nunnaly. But there’s no going back now. I can’t turn back. As long as C.C. and I are bound by our contract, I have to keep at this. Because I don’t wanna lie to myself any more.

???: Your Majesty. The remains have arrived.

Charles: I was just conversing with Clovis actually.

???: Huh?

Charles: The project must proceed without a moment’s delay.

Student: What’s an Eleven doing here?

Student: He was a suspect in Prince Clovis’ murder!

Kallen: But the teacher says the charges were dropped.

Student: He was suspicious enough to arrest, though. Right?

Student: You don’t really think he is a terrorist, do you?

Kallen: Uh…

Student: Of course he isn’t. The school board would know something like that.

Nina: An Eleven here at school?

Rivalz: He is an Honorary Britanian.

Nina: I know… but still all the same.

Shirley: Well he doesn’t look all that scary to me, why don’t we just talk to him? I’m sure he’s totally…

Rivalz: Hey, the guy just got here. Give him some space.

Lelouch: Seven years since we used this signal. Long time, huh?

Suzaku: Meeting on the roof like the old days.

Lelouch: Yeah.

Suzaku: I’m glad you’re okay. I’ve been worried.

Lelouch: Alive and kicking thanks to you. You almost died trying to protect me.

Suzaku: I was just returning the favor from 7 years ago.

Lelouch: Uh.

Suzaku: Ah, what about that girl? You know, from the capsule.

Lelouch: I don’t really know. We got separated during the fray. But you would know more about her than I do, right?

Suzaku: No. The only ones who knew anything were the inner circle of the Royal Guard.

Lelouch: I see.

Suzaku: And your name. Do I still call you Lelouch?

Lelouch: The records count my old identity among the dead. I go by the name Lelouch Lamperouge now.

Suzaku: Oh.

Lelouch: And you? What happened at your court-martial? And why did you enroll at the school?

Suzaku: I’m as surprised as you are. What are the odds that we’d end up at the same school? Truth is, someone arranged for me to receive a proper investigation. And that person said that a 17-year-old should be in school.

Euphemia: Were all of these painted by Clovis?

Butler: Yes.

Euphemia: Such gentle colors. Very much akin to my brother.

Operator: We’ve successfully identified the guerrillas.

Darlton: That’s good. Now all we need is their hide-out. Get that intel to the Viceroy.

Operator: Yes, my Lord.

Soldier: What a…

Soldier: Is that Cornelia?

Cornelia: Relics of a forgotten age.

Cornelia: Darlton, in here? Correct?

Darlton: Yes, my Lady. Shall we accompany you?

Cornelia: Not for this level of resistance.

Darlton: Understood.

Cornelia: Surrender at once, you feeble-minded Elevens!

Resistance: Down with Britannia!

Cornelia: Doesn’t seem Zero is here. No point in going after them one at a time, I suppose. Vermin. Rot like the filth that you are!

スザクを招く

Nunnaly: Hi, Lelouch! I returned home.

Lelouch: Hi, there! Welcome back, Miss Sayoko. I’ve got a special present for you today.

Nunnaly: Really? What could it be?

Lelouch: H’m.

Sayoko: Huh?

Nunnaly: Ah… Ah! This hand… Thank heaven. I knew it. I just knew you’d be alright.

Suzaku: It’s been a long time, Nunnaly.

Nunnaly: So, tell me you will stay the night, won’t you?

Lelouch: Suzaku’s enrolled as a student at Ashford Academy now. So you can see him anytime you want to.

Nunnaly: Is that true?

Suzaku: Well, I still have military duties, so I can’t be here every day.

Nunnaly: Oh, you’re… you’re still in the military?

Suzaku: Don’t worry. I’ve been reassigned to the Engineering Corps. It’s a lot less dangerous.

Lelouch: How cool. Engineering, huh.

Suzaku: Oh, let me help you.

Lelouch: You just sit down. Unlike seven years ago we get to be your hosts now.

Suzaku: Uh… huh.

Lelouch: It’s funny. You’re lot more mellow than you used to be.

Suzaku: And you are a bit more rough.

Lelouch: Ha-ha. I suppose.

Lelouch: Huh? I told you to stay in my room.

C.C. : That boy out there, he is the Britanian soldier from Shinjuku, isn’t he? Is that wise?

Lelouch: Don’t worry, it’s fine. He’s…

C.C. : Huh?

Lelouch: He is a friend… from the past.

Guilford: You getting out, Jeremiah.

Jeremiah: Lord Guilford! You see I’m innocent, don’t you?

Guilford: Well, it seems in the eyes of the court you are anyway, Orange Boy.

Jeremiah: Huh?

Guilford: Whatever the truth is, Zero got away. And you Pure Bloods let it happen. You’ve been demoted three ranks for failure. You have two options to choose from. Starting over as a pilot, or cultivating in orange farm.

Lelouch: You should come by again. Nunnaly would enjoy it.

Suzaku: Sure. But…

Lelouch: Huh?

Suzaku: Lelouch, I… I don’t think we should be seen together at school.

Lelouch: What do you mean?

Suzaku: Think, how would you explain it. Being friends with an Honorary Britanian? You have to guard your secret. No one can know your royalty.

Lelouch: Ah.

Suzaku: And the same goes for Nunnaly. I don’t wanna cause you any trouble.

Lelouch: Doing it again, huh? Everyone’s needs but your own.

Suzaku: Again?

Lelouch: Forget it.

Suzaku: Eh, thanks for having me. It was a lot of fun. I’ll uh, see you later.

Lelouch: Right.

Suzaku: I’m so glad, you know?

Lelouch: Huh?

Suzaku: I never thought we’d get another chance to talk like this.

Student: Why did they do it?

Rivalz: So, what’s the deal? Something happen to ya yesterday or what? You didn’t even show up for the council meeting.

Lelouch: You know, I kinda tanked that history exam.

Rivalz: Please, I don’t buy that. The way you study? Uh…

Student: Stop you guys…

Phone: It hasn’t made news yet, but the Blood of the Samurai faction was wiped out by Cornelia. They were the largest group we had in central Japan. Look, Zero. It won’t be long until she comes after us.

Lelouch: Just keep your head. Our chance will come.

Phone: But…

Lelouch: Sit tight. I’ll contact you later.

Lelouch: Humph. It’s getting too overly familiar. Maybe I better cut my ties with them.

Nunnaly: Nina!

Nina: Ah! I’m sorry. Am I too loud?

Nunnaly: Not at all. Why are you here? What about class?

Nina: Oh…

Nunnaly: Something wrong?

Nina: Well, it’s… I dunno, a little scary

Nunnaly: Scary?

Nina: We have a transfer student in our class now. It’s that boy who was accused of murdering Prince Clovis. He is an Eleven.

Deliveryman: Oh… Thanks for all the repeat business. Although the name on the account we debit has a guy’s name on it, is that okay?

C.C. : Huh? Trying to hide your mask, huh?

Lelouch: Unlike my geass, the mask is a physical piece of evidence. Huh?

Nunnaly: All right, Lelouch? The tea is ready when you are. That smell! Hey, did you order pizza again?

Lelouch: I’m racking up reward points. I’ll be right down, okay?

Nunnaly: Lelouch.

Lelouch: Hm?

Nunnaly: Maybe you should cut down on the pizza. You don’t want a blubbery belly.

Lelouch: Just don’t touch or rub it, okay?

Nunnaly: Ooh, scary!

Lelouch: Ha-ha-ha.

C.C. : H’m.

Cat: Meow!

C.C. : Ah…

C.C. : Hm? What the heck?

Lelouch: Hm. Yeah, I was wondering if that was going on.

Nunnaly: They’re just being cruel to Suzaku.

Lelouch: No. It’s just… Hm. These things take time. People will come around.

Nunnaly: Isn’t there anything you can do, though? I mean he is your friend.

Lelouch: Hm. Uh!

Cat: Meow?

Lelouch: Aaaaargh!

Nunnaly: Huh?

Lelouch: Hey, give that back!

Nunnaly: Ah… Lelouch?

Cat: Meow… Meow meow!

Lelouch: Yeah, a cat. Ah, stupid little cat! You’ve gotta be kidding me. There’s no way I’m getting exposed by a lousy feline!

C.C. : Huh? That wasn’t my fault, was it? I didn’t touch or rub anything.

Nunnaly. Yeah, that’s right. I think a cat ran off with something pretty important to him.

Milly: Important?

Nunnaly. I’m not sure what exactly, but I’m positive it was something of value to him. Because… I’ve never heard my brother sound like that. He was completely hysterical.

Rivalz: That’s weird. What could be so important to the guy?

Nina: A love letter?

Milly : An embarrassing photo?

Rivalz: Poetry he wrote?

Nunnaly: Poetry…

Milly&Rivalz: Hee-hee-hee.

Milly: Leave it to us! We’ll get our hands on the thing before Lelouch has a chance to blink. Just you wait.

Lelouch: (huff-n-puff) If I had those terrorists with me, we could encircle the enemy. Maybe Kallen? No, she is suspicious of me as it is. Waah!

Lelouch: Ughh…get it together!

Student: So, anyway I told him to buzz off, you know.

Student: Totally? And then?

Student: Come on. You can guess, can’t you?

Student: Uh? What’s up with that cat? Is that the mask Zero wears? Or am I crazy?

Student: No way. Why would it be here?

Lelouch: You two saw it? Forget everything you’ve just seen!

Students: Sure. No problem at all.

Lelouch: Good.

Milly: This is Milly Ashford, your Student Council President. CAT HUNT, everybody!

Suzaku: Cat hunt?

Milly: There is a cat loose on campus that needs to be rounded up. Put everything on hold, people. Participating clubs will get budget priority. And whoever catches our feline friend, will get an Extra Special Prize, a big ol’ kiss from one of the members of the Student Council. Ah-hahaha…

Shirly: Aaaaaaah!

Kallen: Members of… Wait! Like, me?

Guys: Exactly!

Kallen: Ahh!

Guy 1: You’ve been hanging around the Student Council, haven’t ya?
Guy 2: Wouldn’t mind a taste of those lips.
Guy 3: It’s not gonna be like some lame peck on the cheek though, is it?
Guy 4: A kiss on the cheek would be fine with me.
Guy 5: Wait. We can choose where she plants it?
Guys: Yeah. All right!

Kallen: There’s no way that’s how I’m gonna get my first kiss!

Student: What? From a member of the Student Council?

Student: Does that include Lelouch?

Student: Actually I would prefer Milly.

Student: Ah. Could you get back in the closet, please?

American football club members: Hut hut, fight!

Horseman club member: We have the advantage of mobility.

Gardening club member 1: Hurry, you look for catnips!

Gardening club member 2: Science will prevail!

Milly: And when you do catch that cat, bring what it’s carrying to me, to me, to me! cough

Lelouch: Milly? Stay out of this, will ya?

Kallen: Offering people up as prizes, that’s why I hate Britanians.

Student: I could hardly believe it.

Student: I was like, floored when I heard it. Ha ha.

Kallen: Damn it! Why do I have to pretend like I’m sick and feeble?

Kallen: Oh, yaah! Huh. Jeez, I’m sorry about that… ah, Shirley! Why are you dressed like that?

Shirly: I didn’t have time to change. They’re gonna make us kiss somebody. We’ve gotta hurry!

Kallen: I’m with you.

Nina: Nunnaly, is there anything about this cat that’s special?

Nunnaly: Hmm… I think that its leg must be hurt, because its footsteps sounded off to me. And, uh… Oh, I almost forgot. It meowed like this. inhaling** Miaow!

All the students: Meeow!

Cecile: The school seems so laidback, in spite of the fact that they’re in mourning. You suppose Suzaku will be alright in here?

Lloyd: Never mind that. The university here…

Cecile: Don’t worry. I’ve made arrangements with them.

Lloyd: Hmm. They still didn’t have to kick poor Lancelot out, though.

Cecile: I know. Even if they did say Elevens aren’t acceptable.

Milly: Okay! Let’s go!

Rivalz: What happens if a member of the Student Council catches the cat? We don’t get a prize, do we?

Milly: Do we get a kiss? But of course.

Rivalz: Is that so. Well, what are we waiting around for, then. This is my day to shine!

Teacher: Hey, no speeding on campus!

Cat: Meow-wow.

Kallen: O.K. We do this right and our lips will be safe. Shirley, you cover the rear. Humph.

Shirley: Oh, wait a sec!

Kallen: What’s the matter?

Shirley: Who would you wanna get a kiss from? Is there anyone in particular?

Kallen: Huh?

Shirley: It wouldn’t be Lelou, would it?

Kallen: Uh. Just what would make you think that?

Shirley: Oh, how… I guess it… it’s just…

Suzaku: Hey, that’s…

Lelouch: Suzaku!

Suzaku: Lelouch! You’re looking for the cat, too?

Cat: Meow.

Suzaku: Up there.

Lelouch: Suzaku, wait! Don’t go up there!

Suzaku: But the Student Council President said to catch it.

Lelouch: Don’t worry about it. I’ll get the cat.

Suzaku: I was always more agile than you. Remember when that little bird got loose?

Lelouch: Quit talking ancient history.

Suzaku: It was only 7 years ago.

Lelouch: Oh, for Pete’s sake…

Suzaku: He always was an exercise nut.

Milly: So, someone’s got it cornered, huh?

Kallen: Who’s the lucky winner?

Shirley: Up there!

Shirley: Suzaku?

Suzaku: Easy now. You don’t have to be scared.

Lelouch: Suzaku, come back!

Suzaku: It’s alright. Leave this to me.

Lelouch: That’s funny. He never went along with the crowd like this. Waaah!

Crowd: Oh!

Suzaku: Huh? Ah… Lelouch!

Suzaku: Are you… okay?

Lelouch: Y… Yeah.

Nina: Is it possible? Those two are…

Cat: Meow?

Lelouch: Haa…

Suzaku: Pretty calm for someone on the verge of death.

Lelouch: Yeah, right. I was just limp with fear.

Milly: Huuuh.

Nunnaly: Hey, what’s going on?

Milly: That transfer student just saved Lelouch from a really closed call.

Nunnaly: Ah… hah.

Suzaku: I think it’s the same cat from the other day.

Shirley: You saved him. Thank you so much, Suzaku.

Rivalz: Yeah. Way to go there, new guy.

Milly: That cat was carrying something, wasn’t it?

Suzaku: Yeah, there was something on its head. But I never really got a good look at it. Guess it’s slipped off when I wasn’t looking.

Shirley: So, where is Lelou?

Suzaku: Eh, He said he forgot something. Told me to go ahead.

Milly: That’s it! The embarrassing secret that he’s hiding.

Lelouch: So, that’s it, Madam President?

Milly: Hm? Aaah, after all this time I thought I had some dirt on you.

Shirley: Yeah. He almost lost his cool for once.

Kallen: So, ah… do you two know each other, then?

Nina: Yeah, but… He is an Eleven.

Suzaku: No. I just…

Lelouch: He is my friend. Madam President, would you permit him as a member of the Student Council?

Council members: Huh?

Lelouch: The rules are clear. All student are required to join a club. Although…

Council members: Uh…

Milly: Well, you are the Vice President. I suppose I can’t refuse.

Nunnaly: Well then, I’d say that’s the end of that. Now, come here you two. Lend me an ear.

Suzaku: N… Nunnaly?

Nunnaly: There you go, the reward Miss Milly promised. Since you both caught the cat, you’ll just have to settle for me, almost a student council member.

Rivalz: Alright then, let’s celebrate the catching of the cat! Everything’s on the new guy, naturally.

Shirley: Oh, back off! Hi, there! I’m Shirley. Pleasure to meet ya.

Rivalz: Oh, right. I’m Rivalz.

Milly: Milly Ashford, Student Council President.

Suzaku: The pleasure is mine.

M.C. : And now, His royal Majesty, the 98th Emperor of the Holy Britannian Empire.

Charles: All men, are not created equal. Some are born swifter of foot, some with greater beauty, some are born into poverty, and others born sick and feeble. Both in birthland and upbringing, in sheer scope of ability every human is inherently different. Yes, that is why people discriminate against one another, which is why there is struggle, competition, and the unfaltering march of progress.

Charles: Inequality, is not wrong, equality is. What of the EU, which made equality a right, rabble politics by a popularity contest. The Chinese Federation, with its equal distribution of wealth, a nation of lazy dullards. But not our beloved Britannia, we fight, we compete, evolution is continuous.

Lloyd: Evolution, such a pretty little word.

Charles: Britannia alone moves forward, advancing steadily into the future. Even the death of my son Clovis demonstrates Britannia’s unswerving commitment to progress.

Charles: We will fight on. We shall struggle, compete, plunder, and dominate. And in the end, the future shall be ours. All Hail Britannia!

Audience: All Hail Britannia! All Hail Britannia! …

C.C. : So, this is Lelouch’s enemy. Well…

Emcee : Announcing. Prince Lelouch vi Britania, 17th heir to the royal Britanian imperial throne.

Vassal: I heard the Empress Marianne was killed inside of the Britanian Palace.
Vassal: There’s no way terrorists could’ve gotten in there.
Vassal: Which means that the real assassins must have been…
Vassal: Shhh. Beware, my friend. You’ll regret it if anyone hears that kind of talk around the Palace.
Vassal: And yet the boy remains… even though his mother is dead.
Vassal: It’s over. And the Ashford family who stood behind them is finished as well.
Vassal: And his sister, the Princess?
Vassal: We understand she was shot in the legs.
Vassal: And that she lost her sight.
Vassal: Blindness caused by trauma though, isn’t it?
Vassal: No difference. Now she can’t even be married off for political gain.

Lelouch : Hail, Your Majesty. My mother the Empress is dead.

Charles : Old news. What of it?

Lelouch : What of it?

Charles : You sought an audience with the Emperor of Britania simply to inform me of that? Send the next one in. I have no time for these childish games.

Lelouch : Father!

Royal Guards: Yes, Your Majesty.

Lelouch : Why didn’t you keep mother out of harm’s way? You’re the Emperor, the greatest man in this nation if not the world. You should have protected her and now you don’t even visit Nunnally?

Charles : I’ve no use for that weakling.

Lelouch : That weakling?

Charles : That is what it means to be Royalty.

Lelouch : Then I don’t wanna be your heir. I give up my claim to the throne!

Vassals : Oh.

Lelouch : I’m sick of fighting and scheming over who will succeed you, father. I’ve had enough!

Charles : You are dead.

Lelouch : Eh…

Charles : You have always been dead to me, dead from the moment you were born. Who gave you the fine clothes you wear, a comfortable home, the food you eat, and your very life? All of those, I have given to you. In short, you are nothing to me because you have never existed. Yet you dare to speak such foolishness to me?

Lelouch : Eek! Aaah!

Charles : Lelouch! You are dead. Therefore, you are not entitled to any rights. I am sending you and Nunnally to Japan as Prince and Princess you will serve well as bargaining tools.

Lloyd : It’s a seventh generation Knightmare Frame, making its abilities far greater than normal…

Cornelia : I understand that the Lancelot’s pilot is an Eleven.

Lloyd : That’s correct, an Honorary Britanian. However…

Cornelia : I’m promoting this man from private to warrant officer, that should satisfy him. I’m trying to win without having to rely too much on the Numbers.

Euphemia : Those who risk their lives on the battlefield are the ones who deserve to rule. I understand the theory, sister. But still…

Suzaku : Sorry, you have to sit here watching me do my homework.

Cecile : Oh, don’t worry about it. You’ve never attended a regular school before, so it can’t be avoided.

Suzaku : The guys on the Student Council are helping me, too. But… it’s still hard.

Cecile : Hehehe. To be perfectly honest with you, I’ve been a little bit worried. It’s supposed to be a liberal school, but I was afraid you were fitting in well.

Suzaku : Me, too. I was expecting that. But I happened to run into an old friend there and he smoothed everything out for me.

Cecile : Be sure you never take that friend for granted. If your friendship continues, your reunion won’t have been coincidence. It will have been predestined.

Suzaku : O.K.

Cecile : Anyway, please try one of these.

Suzaku : Thank you, I will.

Cecile : I’d like your opinion of them.

Suzaku : There’s… jam.

Cecile : Yes. I just happened to get some lovely blueberries.

Lloyd : Alright, everyone. Pack it up, pack it up. Well done today. Don’t do anymore. Hip, hip, hurrah! That’s all folks… haah.

Suzaku : Ah… Um…

Cecile : Go to school. Classes might be over for the day, but it’s important to meet your friends and have a social life, too.

Shirley : Say, can I ask you something important?

Kallen : Uh-huh. Sure, what is it?

Shirley : Ah, Kallen, are you hiding something from us?

Kallen : Huh?

Shirley : If it’s something too personal…

Kallen : No. What are you talking about?

Shirley : You can tell me. I promise I won’t be shocked or upset. Uh well the thing is I happend to see you before.

Kallen : Um…

Shirley : Urghh, you’re going out with Lelou, right?

Kallen : Lelou?

Shirley : The other day I saw you outside.

Kallen : Ah, no no no no. That was all his doing.

Shirley : His doing?

Kallen : No, wait! It wasn’t like that.

Shirley : I don’t get it. You were trying so hard to catch the cat before.

Kallen : No, that wasn’t it. Besides it’s not like we kissed or anything.

Shirley : Or anything? Then you stopped short of doing it?

Kallen : Will you quit imagining things? You don’t understand the circumstances one bit!

Milly : But an arranged marriage is so… I understand how much you want to reestablish the Ashford family. But mother, it’s just that…

Nina : Ah, I’ve divided it!

Darlton : The Saitama Ghetto is now completely surrounded. The Yamato Alliance’s hide out is located at somewhere in here. Half the people in this neighborhood are cooperating with them. So, if we proceed now…

Cornelia : What will be the effect on production?

Darlton : Primary sector output should decrease by 0.2%

Cornelia : Within expectations, you mean. All right. All of you here participated in the Shinjuku disaster. Is that correct?

Subordinate: Yes. And we’re indebted to you Princess Cornelia for your mercy.

Cornelia : That’s not what I’m asking. Do you think the conditions are similar?

Subordinate: Huh?

Cornelia : To those in Shinjuku.

Announcer: Mlitary authorities report that they have surrounded the Saitama Ghetto, a known hiding place for terrorists. Viceroy Cornelia is also on the scene, and entry to that area is restricted.

C.C. : Hum-hum-hum. Oh, well? What has you looking so serious?

Announcer: It appears that a full scale assault will be launched in two hours. Consequently, power will be shut off…

Staff : News is one thing, but why are we broadcasting the start time?

Diethart : Because they are trying to provoke Zero.

Cornelia : Zero is a criminal with a flair for theatrical. I’ve recreated the same conditions that existed in Shinjuku in order to draw him out. If he’s the over-confident type, I predict he’ll come here to try to kill me.

Subordinate: Viceroy, you’d really risk your own life like this?

Cornelia : What you fail to understand is war is a strrugle between pride and life.

C.C. : You’re not falling for the enemy’s provocation?

Lelouch : They went to such trouble to invite me, though. Besides, there’s something I’d like to ask Cornelia personally.

C.C. : Destroying Britannia or discovering who murdered your mother, which is more important to you?

Lelouch : The two are of equal importance. The royal family members are competing with each other to see who will ascend the throne and become the next ruler. Or rather, they’re being forced to fight by that man.

C.C. : But the very thing you hate is the same thing that makes Britannia strong. The royal heir who is best fit become the next ruler of Britannia is the last one left standing.

Lelouch : Exactly. The weak ones lose and they’re cast aside. Britannia is that kind of nation. That kind of world.

C.C. : Survival of the fittest is the most basic rule of all.

Lelouch : If that’s true, then what happens to Nunnally? Should I simply give up on my sister because she’s frail? I refuse to accept that. I’ll wipe out that sort of world myself.

Suzaku : (Humming)

Kallen : Like I’ve said, there’s nothing between Lelouch and I!

Suzaku : Lelouch?

Kallen : Anyway, that’s how it is. There’s nothing going on.

Suzaku : Huh? Um… where is Lelouch?

Shirley : I don’t know where he is. And I don’t give a damn!

Suzaku : Huh?

C.C. : You can’t go, Lelouch. You need to fulfill your part of our bargain, so I won’t have you dying before that.

Lelouch : Notice that what you’re saying and what you’re doing are contradictory.

C.C. : Oh, I won’t kill you. I’m merely going to shoot you in the leg to quiet you down.

Lelouch : Now I get it. You are unable to use Geass yourself, aren’t you?

C.C. : (gasp)

Lelouch : I’m not surprised. I suspected as much. You obviously wouldn’t have ask me to do it if you could’ve done it yourself.

C.C. : Do you honestly think you can threaten me with a gun?

Lelouch : Yes, I do.

C.C. : Huh.

Lelouch : Until I met you I was dead. An empty corpse existing behind a false guise of life, a life in which I did nothing real. Day to day, I merely went through the emotions of living as if I were a zombie. And I always had the feeling that I was gradually dying. If I’m condemned to go back to that, then I’d rather…

C.C. : Stop it.

Lelouch : Humph.

C.C. : I see now. It’s life without meaning. And a life like that…

Civilian : Aaah…

Civilian : Oh, my God. Why the hell did you do that? Even children are here. What’s going on? We haven’t done anything.

Soldier : That’s exactly why. The people of this ghetto refused to report the terrorists. You hide them, cover for them. That’s treason against a suzerain state!

Darlton : We’ve done sweeping away those in charge.

Cornelia : It’s nearly time to set our plan motion. So shall we begin?

Darlton : Right. Attention all forces. Commence eradication of the Saitama Ghetto.

Darlton : All forces, assume No. 1 battle stations.

Jeremiah : I don’t understand. Why won’t Princess Cornelia order us to attack as well?

Kewell ; She won’t because Orange is here. Just be thankful that you haven’t been disposed of. You’re to blame for this. It’s due to you that our careers are over.

Jeremiah : You’re wrong. Zero’s the one who did it.

Kewell : That again, humph.

Villetta : Zero. Could that student be working with him?

Commander: Suppression of area 4 complete. 8th and 11th mechanized infantry companies are sweeping north and south in a pincer movement.

Lelouch : Always the same. Cornelia replaces Clovis, yet Britannia never changes.

Kightmare Pilot: What unit are you from? Your unit name and ID, soldier.

Lelouch : Private Dario Torres[?], sir. With Third Reconnaissance Company. I obtained this item from one of the terrorists. Could I ask you please transmit it to headquarters for me, sir?

Kightmare Pilot: Disc, huh? Well, I still need to verify your ID first.

Lelouch : Right, understood. But before we do that, sir, I’d like to borrow your Sutherland. So, hand it over.

Kightmare Pilot: Sure. No problem. Just take good care of it.

Lelouch : Thank you, I really appreciate it.

Yamato member: It’s hopeless.
Yamato member: Can’t we break through along the Saikyo Line.
Yamato member: They got armor blocking it. We can’t use backroads, either. Any reinforcements from Akabane or Jujo?
Yamato member: One man might get through but not a group.
Yamato member: Izumi!
Yamato member: Damn. Any words of Toda or Kawaguchi districts?
Yamato member: Forget that. Listen!
Yamato member: Huh?

Lelouch : This, is Zero.

Yamato member: Zero!

Yamato member: Zero, you mean?

Lelouch : I assume all of you have heard about the Shinjuku incident. Do what I say, and you will be saved.

Yamato members: Ooh.

B-12 Pilot: B-12, suppression complete.
F-7 Pilot: F-7, no sign of the enemy.
D-24 PIlot: D-24, we are 87% complete.

Commander: Paladin team, change course to 5-1-6.

: Yes, my Lord. moving to 5-1-6.
Sutherland Pilot : No response at all. This guy Zero might turn out to be a no show.

Sutherland Pilot : Yes, he’s just another run of the mill terrorist.

Yamato member: They came! They really came!

Yamato member: Just like Zero said they would!

Lelouch : Now then. Shall I drag Cornelia out, or should I make an opening? R-1, R-2, maintain distance. Draw them back to the area where N-2 is. B-7, open fire towards 2 o’clock. P-5’s team will commence its barrage.

Operator :** * team, contact lost.
Operator : Enemy spotted in district G-4-7.
Operator : Kuznetskii team engaging. They were ambushed.
Operator : The enemy appears to be using Sutherlands captured from our own forces.

Subordinate: Exactly the same as Shinjuku.
Subordinate: Has that ever been any sign of Zero yet?

Lelouch : N-2, continue towards the upper-right. R-4, fire. N-1, take the man on the left. Right. P-3, take out the bridge and close down the route now.

Operator : Point 1-7 has fallen. Hally team, contact lost.

Cornelia : That’s enough. Order all troops to fall back. Further damage and casualties serve no point.

Subordinate: Fall back?
Subordinate: With all due respect, we can still fight them.

Cornelia : We can’t fight them like this.

Darlton? : All forces, fall back behind Ghetto perimeter at once. Formation dosen’t matter. Fall back behind Ghetto perimeter at once.

Lelouch : What? No stomach for it? If I blend in with the retreating units that’d put me right next to Cornelia. Have I cleared the task at hand already?

C.C. : Heh heh. You can’t fight your own blood, can you? But regardless, that type of person is dangerous. I wonder which path he’ll take. I understand. Just who do you think I am, anyway?

Shirley : Hmm. So, Lelou lived here before this became Area 11, huh? Was he a neighbor?

Suzaku : Uh… what about yourself?

Shirley : Myself? I guess we’re a lot alike in that respect. Honestly I didn’t like Lelou at the beginning when I first met him. He gave impression that he was flippant, and only thing he worked hard at was avoiding hard work.

Suzaku : Ah.

Shirley : But back when we were both fleshmen, I happened to see him come upon a traffic accident. A driver rear-ended another car and was clearly at fault, but he tried to blame on the elderly owners of the other car. Nobody tried to help them. And then… Ah, Lelou didn’t do it so he could boast to his buddies or laugh about it later. He did it with the same bored expression he always wears. That’s when I wondered, “What’s up with this guy? What goes on his mind? What does he wanna do?” I really wanted to know and in the process of finding out…

Suzaku : You fell in love with him?

Shirley : Huh, um… You think that what this is? Maybe you’re right.

Milly : How dreamy it is to be in love. Oh, how I wish.

Lelouch : Cornelia, you’re no match you’ll lose.

Cornelia : Zero is no match, I’ll win.

Subordinate: Huh?

Darlton : Of course. That’s why we call Princess Cornelia the Goddess of Victory.

Cornelia : Shall we go, then, Guilford my knight?

Guilford : It is my pleasure to serve and obey you, my Lady.

Lelouch : Humph. Even with my Geass, the normal security makes it too risky for me to simply stroll in. I guess I’ll have to create an opening as I did with Clovis. Hmm? Student Council room? I thought the Cat Festival meeting was scheduled for tomorrow.

Shirley : I know Kallen said I had it all wrong, but it seemed like she was getting upset in order to fool me.

Suzaku : Which is why in this case, it’s best to simply ask him directly. On your behalf, I can ask him how he feels about you.

Shirley : What? You’d really do that?

Suzaku : Just relax. It’ll be fine.

Shirley : Are you nuts? No way!

Lelouch : Hm? Oh, whatever.

Suzaku : Aw, come on. Let me handle this for you. I’ll be discreet.

Shirley : I don’t want your help, okay?

Suzaku : It’ll be fine. Oh!

Cat : Meeow!

Suzaku : Sorry.

Shirley : Ah…

Suzaku : Oooh!

Cat : Grrr.

Shirley : Uh-oh. Does that hurt much?

Suzaku : Greatly.

Lelouch : You’re desperate, Cornelia, using your Royal Guard in such a manner. This is Zero. N-1 will reengage their IFF signal. Operate as a Britannian unit.

N-1 : Understood.

Lelouch : … as my decoy.

Darlton : One Knightmare left transmitting an IFF signal within the city area.

Subordinate: Can’t you contact it?
Subordinate: Scrabble the rescue team!

Cornelia : No, destroy it.

Subordinate: You can’t!
Subordinate: He might be a captive of the enemy.

Cornelia : I ordered all troops to fall back. I have no use for soldiers who can’t follow my orders.

Darlton : You heard the Princess.

Subordinate: But!

Cornelia : Do your duty even if it costs your life. My subordinates follow that code without question.

Guilford : At your command, your Highness.

N-1 : Hey! What’re you guys doing? Can’t you read the IFF signal? I’m on your side!

N-1 : Damn it!

Lelouch : No confirmation? Well then.. N-2, transmit signal then fall back to the hospital ruins. R-1, R-2, hold your positions, fire only if attacked.

Cornelia : They’ve transmitted another signal which means one thing. They’ve set an ambush. Send in more Gloucesters and surround them.

Lelouch : They’re not following? No, damn it! R-1, R-2, abort the ambush and fall back at once. Abort!

Operator : Gloucesters have arrived at the indicated area. No sign of the enemy.

Cornelia : He anticipated my move. It’s possible we really are dealing with Zero himself.

Lelouch : P-2, N-3, circle around behind the enemy. What’s wrong? Come in! P-2, N-3! Damn it! B-1, B-5, move in!

B-1? : Like hell! There’s no way we can beat Cornelia’s Royal Guards. That’s a death sentence. I’m out!

Yamato member: Hey, all we surrender.
Yamato member: We won’t resist.
Yamato member: Spare us.

Cornelia : Kill them.

Lelouch : P-6, P-8, what’s happening? Aargh! B-7, circle around and cover N-4.

N-4 : This is B-7. I’ve got a prime target here. I’ll take him out first.

Lelouch : No, hold fire! That’s a decoy. B-7, that’s an order!

N-4 : What d’you mean? I’ve got this bastard right in my sights!

Lelouch : Fall back! They’ll strike from above. B-7, fall back!

N-4 : Aargh…!

Lelouch : Idiot! B-8, this is Zero. I want a status report now.

B-8 : Screw your status report! Aargh…!

Lelouch : B-8! Damn! Anyone who’s left, report in from the P-group now.

Commander: Mission complete. All forces, take formation No.4.

Lelouch : Beaten as easily. But that’s not how the game was supposed to go.

Cornelia : This didn’t work out the way it did in Shinjuku, Zero. So, are you still masquerading as one of us? We’ll discover who you are shortly.

Lelouch : This… This is what real organization can do.

Cornelia : Attention, all Knightmare pilots. Open your hatches and reveal your faces.

Lelouch : Ah. Cornelia!

Cornelia : Huh. I repeat, all pilots, open your hatches and show me your faces.

Lelouch : What do I do? If she gets me in a line-up without my mask, my identity will be exposed. That mustn’t happen. Use my Geass? No, impossible. It won’t work unless I look directly at them. The enemy is protected within Knightmares. That leaves the infantry and the other pilots. Forget it, they’re too many of them. How do I turn this around? No, would that work? Show them I’m Zero then use the power? But then the Knightmares. Maybe I can start shooting and break out of here? Impossible, against Cornelia’s Royal Guard that would be suicide.

Guilford : Open your hatch. It’s your turn. What’s wrong? Hurry up and open your hatch.

Lelouch : Well, my hatch was damaged earlier in battle.

Guilford : I see, then we’ll open it for you. Turn around. Well, come on!l

Lelouch : Yes, understood. At once, Sir.

Soldier : Zero’s been sighted!

Lelouch : Hm?

Cornelia : Aha, I was right. Zero has a flair for the dramatic.

Lelouch : No way!

Guilford : Capture him! Platoon 3 and 5, stay…

: Image detected. Target confirmed.
Lelouch : I’ll just have to play along.**

: Head around back.
 

: Sharpshooters, open fire!**
 

: He fell!
Guilford : Your Highness, how do you want us to proceed now?

Cornelia : Hmm. Any likelihood it’s a trap?

Darlton : There’s always that possibility. Especially since we don’t know anything about this person, aside from the fact that he seems as prideful as you anticipated, Viceroy.

Cornelia : Then there’s no point in chasing him.

Darlton : Correct. If he intentionally revealed himself directry to his enemy, he must already have an escape route already in place.

Cornelia : So self-preservation trumps all?

Lelouch : That’s how Cornelia is. She’s nothing at all like Clovis. Ah!

Lelouch : Why did you rescue me?

C.C. : I told you already. I can’t have you dying.

Lelouch : I wouldn’t have lost if the conditions were equal.

C.C. : You sore loser. If you’re really that good, you should be able to set up conditions the way you want.

Lelouch : That’s what I’ll do then, I’ll set them up. I’ll raise an army that can’t lose to Britannia. A people, a nation!

Narrator: Lelouch, a Britannian youth, has been given a god-like power by the mysterious young woman, C.C. Geass. The absolute power to compel anyone to follow any order. For the sake of his younger sister, Nunnally, Lelouch plots to destroy the Holy Britannian Empire. Meanwhile, his best friend from childhood — Suzaku Kururugi — has established himself as an Honorary Britannian within the Empire. At this point, their lives are already intertwined and their destinies predetermined with inevitable outcomes.

Shirley: I’ve never left the Tokyo Settlement before, this is my first time!

Milly: I’m sure you wish Lelouch could have come with us, don’t you?

Shirley: No, ah.

Milly: Don’t be so shy. Tonight we can stay up all night talking. Let’s tell each other which boys we like from school.

Shirley: Then you’ll probably have a lot to talk about, right Ms. President?

Milly: Who can say?

Nina: Ah!

Milly: Nina, it’s all right. There are lots of Britannian tourists at Lake Kawaguchi so security’s fine. Don’t be afraid, it’s not the ghettos.

Nina: Yes, but…

Milly: We’ll be with you the whole time. We won’t leave your side for a second.

Nina: Thanks.

Shirley: Haaah!

Ougi: Ah.

Zero: What are you waiting for? Come in. As of now, this place will be our hideout.

Ougi: So, you think joining up with us is a good idea?

Zero: Yes. We’re comrades, after all.

Tamaki: Holy cow.

???: So what is this, huh?

Ougi: Do you mind if I ask how you came by this?

Zero: I borrowed it from a rather libertine nobleman who indulges my requests.

Ougi: You asked for it, just like that?

Zero: Don’t worry, no strings attached.

???: It’s huge. Check it out, it’s got a second story.

Kallen: On the other hand, no one would expect us in something like this.

???: It’s even got a TV.

News Anchor: How are things looking at the scene?

Reporter: I’m here in front of the Lake Kawaguchi Convention Center Hotel. The hotel-jackers have identified themselves as the Japan Liberation Front.

Tamaki: Huh?

Ougi: What’s happening?

Reporter: Members of the Sakuradite Allocation Meeting, most notably Chairman James, were taken hostage, as well as several tourists and hotel employees. This footage was taken by the perpetrators. In it, you can clearly see Chairman James, including some students.

Kallen: From the Student Council.

Zero: Hm?

Reporter: The leader of the group claims to be Lieutenant Colonel Kusakabe of the now defunct Japanese…

Toudou: That imbecile!

Reporter: Sakuradite, an essential component in the manufacture of high-temperature superconductors, is a vital strategic resource that directly affects world security. Area 11 is the largest producer of this material, providing 70% of the world’s total supply. Here at the yearly national meeting of sakuradite producers, it will be determined how this resource will be distributed among the world’s nations. It’s no exaggeration to say that the outcome determines the balance of global power between Britannia and other countries. It is believed that the terrorists are using world interest in the annual gathering to their advantage by carrying out this violent hotel takeover.

Kusakabe: I’m Kusakabe of the Japan Liberation Front. This stand we’re taking is for the freedom of Japan and our countrymen. Even though you are not soldiers you are still Britannians. You are the ones who rule and oppress us. Sit still, be quiet, and you’ll be fine. If you don’t…

Shirley: Lelou…

???: So they made their move.

Ougi: They’re easily the biggest anti-Britannian force in Japan, and now their pride’s hurt.

???: Because of us?

Ougi: Maybe.

Tamaki: I don’t know whether to feel happy or sad about that, because they’re all gonna end up dead.

Zero: Rivalz?

Rivalz: Ah, Lelouch, I’ve…! Huh?

Lelouch’s Phone: This is Lelouch, please leave a message after the beep.

Rivalz: What the hell’s he doing at a time like this?

Lelouch: I know, but…

Subordinate: All bridges connecting to the hotel with the exception of the main one have been destroyed. Our attempted approaches from the air and water have been unsuccessful. There’s only one route left that will allow us to develop a possible hostage rescue plan. The main utilities tunnel running directly beneath the Convention Center Hotel. Basically, we would go in through this route, destroy the foundation block, and submerge the hotel. Since the tunnel was also built to handle supply deliveries, it should be able to accommodate Sutherlands. Even if the enemy has taken precautions it should be no problem.

Sutherland Pilot: Go.

Subordinate: They’ve been using substandard weaponry, so we’ll have no trouble evading them.

Japanese Liberation Front Pilot: Enemy detected! As expected, they’re moving through the underground tunnel.

JLF Pilot #2: Roger that. Raikou secondary startup, both quad-linkage legs locked. Super Electro Magnetic Shrapnel Cannon voltage confirmed.

Sutherland Pilot: I think these guys have Knightmare rifles. Spread out and break their ranks.

JLF Pilot: Super Electro Magnetic Shrapnel Cannon, fire!

Sutherland Pilot: What?

JLF Member: One shot!

JLF Member: Yes! It works!

JLF Member: The Raikou is a complete success!

Kusakabe: What do you think of that, Britannian pigs?

Darlton: Wiped out?

Subordinate: It looks as though they’ve modified a Glasgow into a linear cannon.

???: Then there’s no way we can break through.

???: What do we do now? If we release the political prisoners as they demand…

Cornelia: We can’t show weakness to terrorists!

Guilford: But, Princess Euphemia, she’s…

Cornelia: Yes I know.

Darlton: Thus far it appears that none of them have discovered that fact. If they learn that Princess Euphemia is among the hostages, they’ll undoubtedly use her as a bargaining chip. She went there just to observe, therefore she isn’t registered along with the other guests.

Geassed Girl: Ah ha ha.

C.C.: Yes, yes, I understand. I’ll do well this time. I’ll try to look out for him but I’m not his guardian.

Suzaku: Can’t the Special Core offer any assistance with the rescue operation?

Lloyd: I’ve already asked them, but we’re in a regular unit and they don’t acknowledge our chain of command. Besides…

Suzaku: It’s too risky to entrust the operation to an Eleven, is that right?

Lloyd: Yet I’m sure you’re aware that Princess Cornelia is very discriminating about Britannians and Numbers.

Suzaku: So the Japanese still aren’t being accepted enough into your structure.

Cecile: If that were true, then what point would there be in even having an Honorary Britannian system?

Reporter: Sir, did your daughter appear to be…

???: Where do you want this?

Ougi: Over there, by the driver’s seat.

???: Hey, what about these boxes here?

Reporter: Is there anything you want to say to the terrorists?

Shirley’s Dad: She was only sightseeing. Shirley is still a student, but these criminals act indiscriminately. Savages… I want to know if Shir- I want to know if my daughter is alright. She hasn’t done anything wrong.

Reporter: All he’s asking…

Lelouch: We need to organize before we fight them again. It’s too soon though, we’re not ready, but we can’t just sit here and do nothing either. Knowing Cornelia, she’ll sacrifice the hostages. Ah, then why doesn’t she make her move? Is it possible…

Kallen: Zero… what will happen to the hostages?

Lelouch: Eventually, there will be no reason to keep those Britannians alive.

Kallen: Yeah… I’m sure you’re right.

Ougi: Hey Zero, I found these. Should I hand them out to everyone? I mean as far as gear goes it looks pretty hip but we’re just a resistance group so…

Lelouch: Wrong!

Ougi: Uh.

Lelouch: We’re not a resistance group, is that clear?

Ougi: Well then, what are we?

Lelouch: What we are, what we’re trying to be… are knights for justice!

 

???: Attention all sniper teams, situation is hold, all team commanders confirm…

Cecile: Those teenage hostages are friends of yours from school aren’t they? They’re still negotiating so let’s not give up hope.

Suzaku: I have faith in the system. I prefer the logic of systems to individualist emotions.

Cecile: Ah…

Suzaku: Ms. Cecile, look.

Cecile: Huh?

???: Situation changing!

Suzaku: That’s…

???: Hotel roof, Alert 2, Status D. Urgent report…

Cecile: What are they going to do to him?

Suzaku: Oh no, don’t do it. Ah! Nooooo!!

 

Kusakabe: Our demands have gone unanswered. Therefore, we will throw one hostage from the roof every thirty minutes until our terms are met. For the sake of the hostages negotiations better be in good faith.

Darlton: This is their warning? Barbarians.

Guilford: For now, we could negotiate just to get the women and children out.

Cornelia: Forget it! If you give in to their conditions even once then you’re simply legitimizing terrorism.

Darlton: Then do we use force?

Guilford: We would pursue that course of action after we secure the safety of Princess Euphemia.

Cornelia: Euphie… I….

Subordinate: Viceroy, it’s Zero! We just received a message from Zero.

 

Diethard: What? What do you mean Van 3 was stolen by Zero? What the hell was Gibson doing all the while?

???: He said that when he realized what was happening it was too late.

Diethard: Huh. Then where’s Van 3 now?

???: Driving straight towards the military.

Diethard: Huh?

 

???: We confirm, it’s Zero. Should we open fire?

???: No, just stand by. We’ll capture him after he’s surrounded.

Ougi: Hey, when Zero went off about justice earlier, what do you think he meant?

Kallen: Don’t know, but we may die first before we find out. Seems all of our escape routes have been cut off.

Black Knights Member: I’m just wondering, why didn’t we use that other vehicle?

BK Member: Oh so you want the whole world to see where we hide out huh?

BK Member: Point taken.

Female BK Member: I don’t know about this Zero character, you think we should trust him?

BK Member: No, that’s why I said he looks shifty to me. But if anything goes wrong I’ll do something about it.

Lelouch: Cornelia, much as I’d love to get you back right here and now you’re more useful to me alive. If you do what I predict I won’t need to use my Geass.

Cornelia: Well well, we meet again, Zero. Are you a member of the Japan Liberation Front? Or perhaps you intend to help us? Regardless, our concerns take priority over yours at the moment. And so for the death of my half-brother Clovis, I shall take my revenge right here.

Lelouch: Cornelia, which would you choose: Clovis, who is dead, or Euphiemia, who is alive?

Cornelia: Ah!

Lelouch: My suspicion’s confirmed. The first task at hand is completed. You haven’t changed, dear sister. You’ve always doted on sweet little Euphemia. That’s why you won’t take aggressive action, your emotions are getting in the way.

Lelouch: It’s within my power to save Euphemia for you.

Cornelia: What do you mean? I have no idea what you’re talking about.

Lelouch: I said that I’m able to rescue her.

Kusakabe: Zero you say?

Japan Liberation Front Member: Yes, sir. Word came from the Britannian Army.

Commander: Attention all forces, let Zero pass. I repeat, let Zero pass.

Lelouch: Either the Japan Liberation Front will accept me as their ally, or they’re going to treat me as nothing more than a nuisance. In any event, I highly doubt that they can’t resist the temptation of meeting the infamous Zero. We shall see.

Excellent. All the operation’s preliminary conditions have been cleared.

Darlton: Viceroy, what are we doing?

Cornelia: I believe that by letting Zero go in, we can buy some time before the next hostage is executed. So, this is our chance. We can hit them both at the same time.

Lloyd: Wonderful! I want to thank you for that lovely order. Ha ha ha! They said you’ve got the green light, Lancelot. You’ve orders to charge right into that linear cannon in the tunnel.

Cecile: Wait a minute, you mean they’re using him as a decoy to make an opening for them?

Lloyd: Yep, seems like they’ll use the confusion to send in the royal guard.

Cecile: Seems like? But Lloyd…

Suzaku: Miss Cecile, I’m ready. Please let me do it.

Suzaku: If Lancelot and I are needed, and we’re able to give the hostages an opportunity to be saved, then I’ll do it. Even if it means being a decoy.

???: Warrant Officer Kururugi, here is a guideline for your mission. According to prime search the hostages are located on the hotel’s middle floor and believed to be locked inside a food storage room. Advanced prototype weapon Z-01 Lancelot will use the utilities tunnel to move under the hotel. Once on site you will destroy the foundation block and submerge the building. The area with the hostages should hold out for 8 minutes. Hostage rescue and mop up of the terrorists will be handled by other units. You will be using the VARIS to destroy the foundation. Set the Impact Rail to Anti-Material Level 3.

Lloyd: The only variable in this is that pesky linear cannon waiting for you in the tunnel. Space is tight in there, the Lancelot will only have a 47.8% evasion rate.

Cecile: Are we really going through with this?

Lloyd: Yep, make sure you both pull out of there before it’s too late. Lancelot might be wrecked, that would be unacceptable.

Suzaku: Before it’s too late?

Lloyd: No.[?]

Suzaku: Understood sir.

Shirley: Suzaku, the president and Nina and I are going to Lake Kawaguchi on Sunday. Wanna join us?

Suzaku: Sorry, I have to work that day.

Shirley: You do? Too bad, but I guess that can’t be helped then.

Suzaku: But thank you for inviting me, I really appreciate it. I hope all of you have a great time.

???: Twelve minutes to operation start. Commencing countdown.

 

Nina: An…Eleven.

Japan Liberation Front Member: What did you say?

Nina: Aah!

JLF Member: Not Elevens! We’re Japanese, dammit.

Milly: Yes we’re aware of that. Just lay off of her.

JLF Member: Then correct her, we’re not called Elevens.

Shirley: Fine, we’ll correct her.

JLF Member: How dare you speak like that to me? You three, come with me to the next room and I’ll teach you a real lesson.

Nina: No! No!!

Euphie: Ah.

Woman: Mm-mm.

JLF Member: I said get up now!

Nina: No!! Let me go!

Euphie: Stop it!

JLF Member: Who the hell are you?

Euphie: I demand you take me to your leader right now, understand?

JLF Member: What?

Woman: No Sub-Viceroy, please.

Euphie: You’re addressing Euphemia Li Britannia. The third princess of the Britannian Empire. Are you all right, young lady? You haven’t been hurt?

Nina: Huh? No.

 

Lelouch: You have no intention of joining me?

Kusakabe: Remove that mask and reveal your real face to us. It’s disrespectful not to.

Lelouch: I understand, but before I do, I’d like to ask you something. What exactly do you hope to accomplish by this action?

Kusakabe: Gain attention. I want this country and the world to know that the Japanese aren’t dead yet.

Lelouch: How stale. You people are obsolete, there’s no saving you.

JLF Member: What? Why you arrogant…

Kusakabe: Explain what you mean by that, Zero.

 

Suzaku: ME Boost.

Cecile: Lancelot, now launching!

JLF Pilot: Reaction confirmed, one enemy Knightmare.

JLF Pilot: It moves twice as fast as the others.

JLF Pilot: So what? It’ll end up like the rest. Super Electro Magnetic Shrapnel Cannon, fire!

Suzaku: Guh…

Cecile: I warned you about this, Lloyd!

Lloyd: He doesn’t wanna play decoy, he’s going for the goal.

 

JLF Member: I brought the hostage that I radioed about earlier for the Lieutenant Colonel to see. She claims that she’s Princess Euphemia.

Kusakabe: Zero, there’s no point talking anymore!

Lelouch: Die!

JLF Pilot: Fire!

Crowd: Huh?

JLF Member: Colonel! Ugh!

Lelouch: Calm yourselves.

Euphie: Zero.

Lelouch: The Colonel and the others committed suicide when they realized how meaningless this operation was. Euphemia, you were willing to sacrifice yourself for the commoners. You haven’t changed.

Euphie: Eh?

Cornelia: What? The AE6 Knightmare?

Darlton: Yes. At the rate it’s going it’ll break through soon.

Cornelia: Huh. Do we dare hold out hope?

Suzaku: Yes. It can take this level of destructive force.

JLF Pilot: That thing broke through salvo number five. I can’t believe it.

JLF Pilot: Just don’t panic. Deploy the quad-link free-fire armgun, batteries too. We’ll shield this final defense with our lives.

Suzaku: Ms. Cecile, it’s time for me to use the VARIS.

Cecile: No, you could get killed!

Suzaku: There’s no room for me to evade, I’ll risk getting blasted to take the first shot.

 

JLF Member: Why you stinking son of a…

Lelouch: I heard that you’re the Sub-Viceroy now your Highness, Princess Euphemia Li Britannia.

Euphie: It’s not an appointment I’m happy with.

Lelouch: No, it’s because Clovis was murdered. That was my handiwork. He begged pathetically for his life to the very end. He pleaded with the same tongue that ordered the deaths of Elevens.

Euphie: So is that the reason that you killed my brother?

Lelouch: No.

Euphie: Then why?

Lelouch: Because Clovis was an offspring of the Britannian Emperor. That reminds me. You’re one of his children too, aren’t you?

JLF Pilot: Use maximum output! I don’t give a damn if it destroys the guns. Be prepared to die defending this spot. Smash him!

Cornelia: It’s the Eleven.

Cornelia: He really did it. Guilford!

Guilford: Right.

Suzaku: Ah, no way.

Lelouch: The white Knightmare from before.

Suzaku: Ah!

Cornelia: Euphie!!

Suzaku: My friends!

Lloyd: Warrant Officer Kururugi, don’t!

 

Diethard: What about the cameras in Van 3?

???: I told you, Zero took the Van…

Diethard: Well then, let’s hope we pick up a signal from them. What are you doing, Zero? Wasn’t that part of your plan… to show us something?

Cecile: He’s all right!

Lloyd: Ohh…

Suzaku: I couldn’t rescue them. They’re dead, I failed. Not again!

Diethard: We’ve got it.

Lelouch: My dear Britannians, have no fear. All of the hostages from the hotel are safe and sound. I, Zero, return them to you unharmed.

Suzaku: They’re fine.

Rivalz: Ah, they’re all right.

Cornelia: Of all the brazen audacity… If we attack you those people will quickly become your hostages, won’t they?

Lelouch: People! Fear us, or rally behind us as you see fit. We, are the Black Knights.

Cecile: Black Knights?

Lloyd: Ironic, isn’t it? The terrorists referring to themselves as knights.

Lelouch: We of the Black Knights stand with all those who have no weapons to wield. Regardless of whether they be Elevens, or Britannians. The Japan Liberation Front cowardly took innocent Britannian civilians hostage, and they mercilessly executed them. It was a wanton and meaningless act, therefore they have been punished.

Diethard: You heard me right, I said let it run. Liable? I’ll be the one responsible for this.

Lelouch: Just as former Viceroy Clovis was punished for ordering the slaughter of countless unarmed Elevens, we could not stand by and allow such cruelty to be carried out, and so we made him pay for his actions. I will not repudiate battle on a fair and level field, but neither will I tolerate a one-sided massacre of the weak by the strong. The only ones who should kill, are those who are prepared to be killed! Wherever oppressors abuse their power by attacking those who are powerless, we shall appear again. No matter how mighty, how formidable our foe may be.

Kallen: Knights…for justice?

Lelouch: Those of you with power, fear us. Those of you without it, rally behind us. We, the Black Knights, shall be the ones who stand in judgment of this world.

TV:
…Clearing the last of the debris from around the Lake Kawaguchi Convention Centre Hotel.
It’s been two weeks since Zero unveiled his Black Knights.
But there’s still little insight into the man behind the mask.
They weren’t able to track his escape route?
They let the hostages go and somehow made it to the other shore.

Kallen’s mother:
Kallen. I mean, miss. Forgive me. I didn’t wish to wake you.

Kallen:
Again?

Kallen’s mother:
I’m sorry. It was the step ladder this time, it broke.

Kallen:
Well, just get it cleaned up. And be quick about it. I have to leave for school.

Kallen’s mother:
Mistress, you’ve been attending school quite a bit lately. Making any friends there?

Kallen:
I don’t see how that’s any of your business….Just go, will you.

Man:
I know it’s for welfare, but why waste it on the Elevens?

Man:
That’s why I’m selling it to you, my friend.
The Eleven population could use a little thinning out, if you ask me.

Man:
Your payment will be transferred to your wife’s account.

Man:
Princess Cornelia is a soldier.
This sort of thing doesn’t interest her all that much.
Hit the lights! Turn ’em on!
You’re… you’re the…!

Kallen:
The Black Knights!

Shirley:
That’s not like you, dozing off in class like that.

Kallen:
Well, I ….

Rivalz:
You could learn a thing or two from Lelouch. He’s an expert at sleeping in class.

Kallen:
He’s not sleeping now, is he?

Rivalz:
I don’t know what he’s up to night after night. But he sleeps through about half of them these days.

Cornelia:
The EU is starting an offensive along the El Alamein front.
We can’t go on dragging our feet around here.
I want to solidify domestic affairs.
It’s high time Area 11 was made a satellite nation.
For that to happen we need to stamp out terrorism, of course.
But another major problem is the rampant abuse of Refrain amongst the Eleven.
Productivity is plummeting.
It’s coming in on the Chinese Federation’s Kyushu route.
We have to put an end to it.
Euphemia:
Yes, but be careful.
Cornelia:
You as well.
I don’t want you leaving the settlement.
Euphemia:
Cornelia, what about Black Knights and Zero?
Cornelia:
I’ll let them roam free a bit longer.
I owe them that for saving your life.
However, upon my return…
Once I’ve cleaned up this Area, I’m entrusting it to you.
Try to stay out of harm’s way from now on.
All right, Euphie?

Zero:
Because Clovis was an offspring of the Britannian Emperor.
That reminds me… You’re one of his children too, aren’t you.
But I suppose for now…

Euphemia:
When he spoke to me that night, what was he alluding to?
Suzaku, what would you make of all this?
About what Zero is doing. And of me.

Kallen:
Man, this double life sure is a killer.

Milly:
Come on, Suzaku, hold him down!

Lelouch:
Damn it, Suzaku, cut it out!
Stop it! I’m not kidding!

Suzaku:
Sorry, Lelouch.
But it’s the president’s orders.

Lelouch:
Yeah, like you’re not enjoying this at all!

Shirley:
Will you hold still!
Milly:
Goodmiaoning.
Kallen:
Good morning, I guess.
What is all this?
Rivalz:
What do you mean?
Didn’t we tell you?
It’s our welcome party for Arthur.
Kallen:
Sounds like fun…?
Milly:
Well, classes are postponed, we might as well have some fun, right?
Shirley:
I set some stuff aside for you, over here.
To make up for all my getting so upset before.
Take your pick.
Kallen:
What? For me?
Lelouch:
She doesn’t need a costume.
You’re already wearing a mask, right?
Kallen:
You really are a riot, you know that?
You ought to be on television.
Rivalz:
What do you think, Miss TV Star?
Suzaku:
Oh, I thought that she meant Lelouch.
Shirley:
Would you quit joking about that?
The whole thing’s a huge pain in the butt.
We’ve been hounded with questions day and night.
Even in the bath!

Milly:
We haven’t been able to leave school grounds in a week.

Rivalz:
Not that I don’t feel for you, but I don’t see why we can’t leave either.

Milly:
Hmm, that’s the price of friendship.
The Romance of the Three Kingdoms: “It matters not that we were born apart, upon this day we die as one.”

Rivalz:
Is that your idea of a love quote?

Milly:
If I go down, then we all do.

Rivalz:
That’s a little dark.
Right, Suzaku?

Suzaku:
I’m glad… that we could all be together again.
You know, like this.

Rivalz:
Come on!
Hey, we’re supposed to be unwinding in here!

Shirley:
That’s what’s so refreshing about Suzaku, though.

Milly:
Yeah, but once in a while you just want him to get a clue, you know?

Suzaku:
Oh, sorry about that.

Rivalz:
Oh, you [lovely] puddy cat.

Kallen:
It’s so funny to think I helped save their lives.

Kallen:
Ever since we made our big splash at the hotel jacking, the Black Knights have taken the world by storm.
We’ve become a friend to the weak, just as Zero proclaimed we would.
Terrorists who involve civilians, an overbearing military, criminal syndicates, corrupt politicians and profiteers, if the law would not punish them, then we would.
In the blink of an eye, we’d become heroes.
Support for us has swelled.
And we’ve even gotten our hands on some Knightmares again.
Of course, no one could show that in public, because…
Mother:
Stop pretending you’re a Black Knight.
Child:
But why?
Mother:
You musn’t ever say anything against Britannia.
We’re Elevens.
Have you forgotten that?
Kallen:
Because our leader Zero had killed Prince Clovis.
There are many in our ranks who wish to know his true identity, myself included.
But if we push too hard, I suspect that he would vanish.
And without him, I’m fairly certain we’d be finished.

Rivals: Hey, there, Pal. Haven’t seen you much lately.
Lelouch: Really?
Rivals: Yeah. Really.
Euphemia: Are you alright, young lady?
Urabe: Why would the masses flock around those who saved Euphemia?
Senba: Even Kyoto has said that they would send the Black Knights the Guren MK II.
Asahina: To those would-be Robin Hoods?
Chiba: They’re not part of the resistance. Killing Kusakabe was proof of that.
Urabe: The colonel killed himself, didn’t he?
Senba: Well, I hear they didn’t try to stop him. In any case, lieutenant colonel Todo, we can’t let this stand.
Kallen’s mother: Mistress Kallen, mistress Kallen.
Kallen: Madam president?
Milly: I just dropped by to give you something.
Kallen: Huh?
Kallen’s mother: Where would you like me to show her to? The parlor perhaps. or maybe…
Kallen: We’ll be in my room.
Kallen’s mother: As you wish.
Stepmother: Oh, I heard you had a friend down here, I was sure it would be a boy. Out all night and missing school.
Not to mention all your visits to the getto. You’re lucky your father’s back in the homeland.
No fighting one’s blood, is there?
Kallen: You’re the one who enjoying dad not being around here, aren’t you.
Stepmother: Uh…
Kallen’s mother: Oh dear, what have I done.
Stepmother: What’s wrong with you!
Kallen’s mother: Forgive me, milady, forgive me.
Stepmother: Can’t you do anything right?
Besides selling your body, that is.
Milly: Quite the complicated home life you have. isn’t it.
Kallen: So what was it you wanted to give me?
Milly: Grandfather asked me to pass this on.
Kallen: You mean the principal?
Milly: Your transcript since middle school. I thought I’d better give them to you off of school grounds.
Kallen: So my secret’s out then, isn’t it? That I’m actually an Eleven and Britanian half-breed.
That was my stepmother down there. My real mother was that clod of a maid who knocked over the vase.
Milly: And your father.. is he the head of the Statfeld family?
Kallen: My mother is such a fool. In the end, she wound up a servant. She doesn’t have any real skills.
And no matter who’s ridiculing her, all she can do is laugh like it’s nothing. She didn’t have to chose to
stay in this house, you know? She’s just clinging some old lover who jilted her.
Milly: You really hate your mother, don’t you.
Kallen: I just find her depressing.
Milly: Well, this is getting a little heavy. Imagine, the wife and the daughter and the other woman, all living together.
Kallen: Ah, it could be worse. Three square meals and a roof, right? I mean, it’s not unbearable.
Most of the time, anyway.
Milly: That’s good. Still, somethings in life we can bear on our own, but when you add them all up,
they eventually break you. Oh, don’t worry. I won’t lie, I’m always hungry for secrets, but I’d never talk about this.

Lelouch:
I can’t believe you teared up. That’s so embarrassing.
Suzaku:
It’s called honesty.
Lelouch:
Well, good thing’s the Black Knights were there to save them.
That’s all I can say.
Suzaku:
If they wanted to catch criminals, they could have joined the police force, you know?
Why don’t they, I wonder.
Lelouch:
They probably don’t think the cops are up to the job.
I tend to agree.
Suzaku:
The police may not be that effective right now, but they could evoke change from within.
Lelouch:
Yeah, and in the process, they get all tangled up in red tape and bureaucracy.

Suzaku:
If they had done everything in their power to change things, that might hold water.
As long as they don’t, then all of it’s just self-righteous posturing.
Lelouch:
Self-righteous?
Suzaku:
And what constitutes evil in their eyes?
What standards are they using?
It’s nothing but self-satisfying gratification.
Shirley:
Oh, it’s just you two?
Suzaku:
Anyway, I guess I gotta go back to the base pretty soon.
See you around, Shirley.
Shirley:
See you later.
So Lelou… I was, um…
I was thinking if you had some time, you and I…
Lelouch:
“Back to base”…
Now that was an interesting choice of words.
‘Go back’, implying that’s where he thinks he belongs.

Kallen: Refrain?
Ohgi: It’s a psychotropic, makes you think you’ve gone back to the past.
Kallen: Must be all the rage here in Japan.
Ohgi: Yeah ,well… Who doesn’t long for the days before the occupation, right?
Kallen: Uh…
Ohgi: This stuff was specifically targeted at the Japanese. Can’t very well ignore it.
Soon as the Burais are stocked, we move.
Kallen: Supplys keep rolling in. And I hear lots of people are ready to join us.
Black Knights sure are popular, huh.
Ohgi: Well, we are the heroic knights for justice.
I’ll call you when the ammo gets here.
Man: Come on Eleven, say something.
Man: You are sorry, aren’t ya?
Man: Bowing your heads is what you Elevens do best, right?
Kallen: Eleven…
Man: Eatin’ bad food really makes us wanna off somebody, you know?
Kallen: Lelouch.
Lelouch: No, there’s five of them.
You wouldn’t stand a chance at all.
Kallen: So you think I should just ignore it?
Lelouch: Go on, take a good look at that Eleven.
Man: Come on, what’s the matter?
Man: Aren’t you gonna cry?

Man: Buddy, just say you’re sorry.

Lelouch: If we intervene and help him win, he wouldn’t be able to sell a thing tomorrow.
It was his choice to become a Britannian slave.
That’s just the price you pay for working in the settlement.
Kallen: Well even so…
Man: You got a problem over there?
Man: Not feeling sorry for this Eleven, are ya?
Man: Nah, they feel the same way we do, don’t you guys?
Lelouch: Not quite.
But you’re tired of beating up Elevens now, aren’t you?
Man: Yeah.
This is boring.
Man: You guys wanna hit the arcade?
Man: I got no cash.
Lelouch: Well they got bored pretty quick, huh?
Kallen: Hey, are you all right?
Hot Dog Seller: Huh? A Britannian student!
What can I get for you?
How about a nice California hot dog, miss?
Is this your boyfriend?
I can get him something too.
I have ice cream, if you like?
Lelouch: In some ways, Area 11 is better off now than the old Japan ever was.
Being made a colony of the Empire has stabilized its military and economic position in the world.
Elevens can even attain full citizenship through the legal process.
It’s easy to become a honorary Britannian.
Just a question of pride, really.
Though I can certainly understand why they’d resist.
Kallen: And?
Lelouch: Um?
Kallen: Knowing all that, what does Lelouch Lamperouge think about it at all?
What do you wanna do?
Lelouch: Nothing.
Kallen: You know, you’ve got a lot of brains but you don’t seem to be doing much with them.
It’s all Shirley talks about, saying how intelligent you are but how you barely ever apply yourself.
Lelouch: That’s why I don’t do anything.
That Eleven we saw back there could tell you.
He could lead a better life as long as he bows his head to Britannia.
Kallen: You must think you’re pretty cool, huh? Just playing the critic and judging the world from the sidelines.
Guess I was a fool to expect anything more from you.
You know, I really thought you were a better man than this.
Villetta: So, about this Orange thing…
Sorry to bring it up.
Is this whole thing true, though? That you can’t remember anything about when Private Suzaku Kururugi was taken.
Jeremiah: I don’t except you to believe me.
Villetta: No, it’s just that… during the whole Shinjuku incident, I suffered some sort of memory lapse also.
Jeremiah: You did?
Villetta: By the time I regained my senses, my Sutherland had been stolen.
But right before that entire gap in my memory, I remember running into some high school kid.
Jeremiah: So you think it was that student?
Villetta: I can’t remember his face, but there may still be a way to get to the bottom of this.

: What the hell is Zero thinking?
After all his talk about bringing down Britannia, he’s just got us running around helping the police.
: Still feels pretty good to have the will of the people behind us, though.
: Yeah, he’s right.
We’re totally heroes on the Net.
Kallen: Are we in the right? I don’t know any more.
: Kallen…
: There’s the signal from Zero.
: I can’t believe he got in there.
: How many tricks does this guy have up his sleeve, anyway?
: Is the shipment for Nagoya ready?
: Nice and safe here in the settlement, huh?
: The Black Knights have arrived!
: Intruders!
: The Knightmares!
: Screw this!
Kallen: These Knightmares really are amazing.
Each one is an army unto itself.

Man: Japan! Japan! Japan!

Woman: That’s right, I’m getting married next month!

Man: I’ve been promoted! I’m going to the Paris office!

Man: Leave it to us! Japan is on the vanguard of technology!
Kallen: Refrain…
Man: I’m studying abroad! I can’t believe I got in!
Milly: When you add them all up, they eventually break you.
Kallen: That’s right, which is why I’m here.
Kallen’s Mother: Careful, it’s dangerous to run like that.
Kallen: Mother!?
Kallen’s Mother: Really, Naoto. Please, I need you to keep an eye on your little sister.
Kallen: My God, how weak a woman are you, Mother…
First you give in to Britannia, then to a man, and now this…
My brother is gone forever. Let him go!
The [Night/Knight Police]?!
: Isn’t that a police unit?
: They’re in on this deal?
Tamaki!
Tamaki: Don’t look at me! When I checked it out, there weren’t any cops involved!
Lelouch: Corrupted filth…
Kallen: You’re in the way!
Damn it! I don’t need you!
I don’t want you!
Kallen’s Mother: Kallen… Naoto…
Lelouch: It won’t work on a Knightmare.
Kallen: Go on, run. Get moving, you idiot!
Kallen’s Mother: I’m here for you. I’m here for you, Kallen. I’m here, as I always have been.
Kalen: Then that’s… that’s why you stayed in his house? You stayed there for me? You fool! Or maybe… I’m the fool.
: Kallen!
Kallen’s Mother: I’m so happy for you… You can finally become a Britannian now, Kallen. Nobody will ever be able to hurt you now, darling. And you’re free to travel and use the phone anytime you want.
Lelouch: So this… is her mother?
: False tears bring pain to those around you. A false smile brings pain to one’s self.
: It’s an after-effect of Refrain. She’s unable to talk much. She’ll recover eventually, but it will take time.
Kallen: Mother, your sentence… you got 20 years. But you wait! I’m working to change things when you get out, I swear to you! I’ll make a world where you and I can live a normal life again. So please, Mother…
Kallen’s Mother: Hang in there… Hang in there, Kallen… My little girl…
Kallen: Don’t you worry… I will. I promise you.

Lelouch: Hm, a Britannian?
Looks too confident to be a spy.
An extremist?

C.C: Isn’t it wonderful? How the number of recruits keeps growing.

Lelouch: And it was simpler than I ever expected.
“While I bitterly hate the Britannians, I refused to condone terrorism.”
That’s the prevailing view of most Elevens.

C.C: Then basically elevens support the Black Knights for the most part.

Lelouch: Which in turn makes it easier for us to operate as a whole.
It’s a huge help that people don’t report our activities to the Britannians.
Plus, I hear some group called Kyoto offer to send us some Knightmares.
The number of informants has been increasing quickly, too.
The Japanese can’t resist jumping on the bandwagon.
They hear well grounded buzzword enough they go.

C.C: Hence the “Knights for Justice” act.

Lelouch: Yeah, well everybody loves a hero, and what better hero than a knight.

C.C: I kind of doubt that’s what a real knight for justice would say.

Lelouch: You don’t thinks so?

Diethard: Yes, I was demoted from my position. In very much the same way that you were.

Villetta: We have no intention of letting the situation end this way.
And we have the sneaking suspicion that you don’t either.

Diethard: That’s so? Well, who can say.

Jeremiah: We have a lead that might help us find zero.

Villetta: You’re familiar with Ashford Private Academy?
I want to investigate a male student attending there.
I think he may be working with zero.

Jeremiah: Villetta and I are going to be shipping out with the military soon for duty.
And will be stationed in the Narita mountains.
Therefore…

Diethard: Narita?
Isn’t that where the Japan Liberation Front headquarters are rumored to be located?

Jeremiah: You may be a bit too clever for your own good.

Diethard: You overestimate me.

Soldier: Wow, it’s amazing

Soldier: These are Glassgows, aren’t they?

Soldier: Burais, a Japanese modification.

Soldier: I’ve never seen these before.

Soldier: Man, the Black Knights have gotta some serious muscle.

Soldier: It wasn’t easy to sign up with the BK.

Soldier: So that makes us special. huh?
We’re elites. [I’m totally up.]

Sugiyama: Those guys from Kyoto, They believed in us.
They sent us this.

Soldier: A completely made Japanese Knightmare.

Kallen: A Guren MK2.

Minami: Did you check up the manual?

Tamaki: I’m really love in this.
The big shots in Kyoto are recognizing us.
We’ve got their approval.

Soldier: Tamaki san, would you show me how to use this equipment here.

Tamaki: Oh sure. hang on, I’ll be right there.

Inoue: Newbies, what are you gonna do?

Lelouch: First Tamaki and now Inoue and the rest are treating this like a party.
Kyoto is backing multiple resistance groups, correct?

Kallen: Yes. Which means that we finally made it in. They know that we’re worthy.

Lelouch: No, you’re wrong there Kallen.
This is merely a test they put to us.

Kallen: So, what if it is.
This is still incredible.

Lelouch: You’re an optimist.

Kallen: What’s this?

Lelouch: The Guren Mk-II is yours now, Kallen.

Kallen: Mine? but we have a lot more people now, and we can’t afford to lose you.
We need the Guren’s defense to protect you.

Lelouch: You’re a top notch pilot. I’m a commander.
I’ll use a Burai. But you’re our only ace to play during a battle.
Besides. You have a reason to fight.

Kallen: Right.

Ohgi: Zero. you got a second?
We got some weird intel here from a Britannian who wants to join up with the Black Knights.

Ohgi: This maybe a trap to draw us out.
I’d say even if we wanna confirm the information it’s too risky to contact him directly.
But news like this isn’t something we can just ignore.
What should we do?

Lelouch: This weekend, we’re going hiking.

Ohgi: What?

Lelouch: To the Narita mounts.

Ohgi: Very well, then.

Nunnally: Sayoko, we won’t need any breakfast for my brother this morning.

Sayoko: He’s going out?

Nunnally: He’ll be leaving on a three day trip starting today.

Sayoko: Oh, I see.
My, your brother’s been going out quite a bit recently.
Think it’s a girlfriend?

Nunnally: Maybe it is.

Soldier: Sector five, nothing to report.
Right. The next scheduled report will be in two hours.

Soldier: Of course, there’s nothing to report.
This area’s controlled by the Japan Liberation Front. No one can just stroll in…
Zero!

Lelouch: Relax, I only came to talk.
I want you to ignore any unusual activity during your watch.

Soldier: Sure, no problem.

Soldier: Come on, it’s your turn.

Soldier: What’s the rush.
We’re just on regular duty, you know.

Soldier: I’ve confirmed the signal from Zero.
We’re now moving to way point 2.

Tamaki: Hey, why doesn’t Zero just use the radio in his Burai.

Inoue: And what do you suppose he meant when he said hiking?

Minami: Ah… military training, right?

Tamaki: Only with Zero in another location?

Sugiyama: Maybe we’ll dig a hot spring.

Soldier: Is that why we brought those excavators.

Soldier: Then, hell, I’m all for it.

Tamaki: Kallen, you heard anything about this?

Kallen: I haven’t

Tamaki: You, Ohgi?

Ohgi: Nope, not a word.

Ohgi: Zero wasn’t using the radio to avoid being traced.
Is he serious about this?

Lelouch: The day I’ve waited for has finally come, Cornelia.

Darlton: We’re certain that the Japan Liberation Front headquarters are in this area.
We’ve already split 4 battalions into seven units and hidden them in the vicinity.
We’ve only to wait for the viceroy signal then we’ll surround them in one fell swoop and wipe them out

Euphemia: And are you confident that the enemy won’t show up outside the encirclement line?

Cornelia: You mean Zero?

Darlton: Have no fear about that.
As the operation begins, we’ll be blocking off the surrounding highways and mountain routes also.

Cornelia: Plus, we have reserve units.
If zero is stupid enough to show up, it’ll be the end of him.

Milly: What? You wanna meet her? Are you kidding?
Do you know who you’re talking about?
She’s a princess and you’re just a citizen.
What do you have in common aside from that hotel jacking.

Nina: Yes, but… as for Princess Euphemia, I never got to thank her.

Milly: Hm, there was a time when my family name had the influence to arrange that.
So, tell me Nina, do you know what the social status is of a principal’s grand daughter?

Nina: Um, not a very high one?

Milly: Correct, not very.

Lelouch: C.C., what are you doing here?

C.C: I said that I would protect you, didn’t I?

Lelouch: Aren’t you overdoing it?

C.C: I’ve been wondering about something Lelouch, Why are you Lelouch.

Lelouch: I don’t have time to discuss philosophy with you.

C.C: You changed your family sir name to Lamperouge
but you kept Lelouch the name that was given to you at birth.
How sentimental.
You can’t let go of the past.

Lelouch: Well, C.C. swings to the other extreme, doesn’t it?
It’s not a human name.

C.C: Lelouch, do you know why snow is white?
Snow is white because it’s forgotten what color it’s supposed to be.

Soldier: All units are in position.

Cornelia: Understood.
Euphemia will provide logistical support From G1 as planned.
Have her command medical group.

Soldier: Yes, Your Highness.

Guilford: Princess Cornelia.

Cornelia: Guilford, let me guess.
This is about Euphie, isn’t it?

Guilford: Yes. she really should be in a government agency, not…

Lelouch: But she’s being unusually stubborn about this.
She told me she wanted to see actual combat for herself.

Euphemia: What’s that unit there holding to the rear.

Soldier: Our reserve force with an Eleven pilot.

Euphemia: What? You mean that’s the Lancelot?

Soldier: As a rule, Numbers aren’t permitted to operate Knightmares but that particular unit is an exception.

Soldier: The second prince is the patron of that unit.
We have no say over their personal selection.
But he said he wants them to have as many chances at real combat as possible.

Ohgi: Are you really going through with this?

Lelouch: Our opponent is Cornelia, whose forces are among the best Britannia has to offer.

Ohgi: Then why don’t we cooperate with the Japan Liberation Front?

Lelouch: What was that?
Ohgi, don’t you believe in me anymore?

Ohgi: What do you mean?
I was the one who asked you to be our leader, don’t you remember?

Lelouch: Then there’s only one answer to give.

Ohgi: Right.

Darlton: Viceroy, it’s time.

Cornelia: Right. Commence operation.
You, the Japan Liberation Front.
You, who time has left behind.
You, who have forgotten basic human decency.
You and your dream of a bygone golden age shall fall and rot to nothingness.

Katase: We’re under enemy attack?

Soldier: Yes sir. the Britannian forces has completely encircled the Narita mountains.
We’ve counted over a hundred units.

Lelouch: It’s begun.

Tamaki: Huh? What the hell?
You’ve gotta be kidding, Zero.
Those troops coming in have this whole area totally surrounded.
There’s no way out.

Lelouch: We’ve already been cut off.
Our only chance of surviving now is to fight.

Inoue: What?
We can’t fight the Britannians.

Tamaki: Let me get this straight.
We’re surrounded and you want us to fight them head-on?

Sugiyama: And we’ll be fighting against Cornelia.
Her forces are far stronger than any we’ve encountered.

Lelouch: Correct. It would be a miracle if we win this.

Ohgi: Zero, what are you saying.

Lelouch: Even Messiahs need to perform miracles if they’re to be acknowledged.
Therefore, we have to produce our own miracle, don’t we?

Tamaki: Now look, pulling this off isn’t gonna be cheap! The price could be our lives!
I knew it wasn’t sane to make you our leader!
It should be me!

Lelouch: Our path of retreat has been cut off.
If you think you can win without me then shoot me! Someone, anyone.
Since you’ve joined the Black Knights, you have only two choices.
You may either live with me or you may perish with me.

Soldier: We’re completely surrounded and our underground reserve forces were captured all at once.

Soldier: General Katase. we’ve received the message from Cornelia’s forces demanding our surrender.

Katase: Imbecile.
If we fall here then we’ve lost and the whole resistant movement falls with us.

Soldier: Then general, do we engage the enemy in battle or do we dig in?

Katase: What about Tohdoh.
Where is he?

Soldier: He’s gone to Kyoto.
To get the custom Burais.

Soldier: The four holy swords are traveling with him, too.

Soldier: If they’re on schedule, they should be returning soon. but..

Soldier: Tohdoh won’t make it in time.

Katase: Prepare to send out the Burais.
We’ll break the encirclement on one side and evacuate.
We’ll show them the Japanese spirit and pride.
This is our moment of truth.

Soldier: We believe that the enemy’s main base is located in a mountains here,
but we haven’t pinpointed at yet.
However until we obtain a list of their corroborators,
we can’t burn down everything with our aerial bombing.

Soldier: The enemy is engaging our encirclement, now try to breakthrough with some point.
From there we’ll be able to ascertain where their base is.

Soldier: Our forces are divided into three fronts.
The units let by General Darlton here, General Alex here, and Viceroy Cornelia here.
As for our flanking forces… what?

Soldier: It’s enemy ECM.

Darlton: The main enemy force should be coming out anytime now.
We’re switching to ECCM mode, link up on channel alfa four.
The enemy what are we calling them again?

Soldier: Burais, sir.

Darlton: Right, the rather like pseudo Glasgow, so watchout for them.

Soldier: Yes, my Lord.

Cornelia: How clever, they turned this whole mountain into a fortress.

Guilford: Your Highness, Please fallback.

Cornelia: Guilford, don’t treat me as though I’m another one of your women.

Guilford: Princess Cornelia.

Soldier: It’s Cornelia.

Soldier: Don’t panic. Take out their leader.

Cornelia: Insolent worms!

Guilford: Right, well then I’ll cover you from the rear.

Cornelia: Hm, well Cornelia is here.
Is there no one who will challenge me?

Lelouch: What’s wrong?
Challenge me and try to take me down.

Tamaki: All right, fine. Do what you want.

Sugiyama: We acknowledge you as our leader, Zero.

Lelouch: Thank you very much. I appreciate it.

Announcement: An evacuation order has been issued for this area.
Anyone remaining must evacuate at once.
I repeat. An evacuation order has been…

Researcher: Why did they choose this place…

Researcher: If the military should find the experimental data on Code R, it’s all over.

Researcher: Oh my. Being inside the terrorist area, we thought it would be difficult for them to discover us.

Researcher: This was all General Bartley’s decision, so there’s no use in complaining about it.

Cornelia: They’re too fragile.

Darlton: The enemy seems to be concentrated over here.
This maybe the target.
Split up now.

Soldier: No good.
Our second attack wave had no effect.

Katase: Their sheer dominance is insurmountable.

Guilford: General Darlton, based on the analysis of the enemy’s movements,
I’ve determined that the entrance to the JLF main base is that lodge located up on the mountain.

Darlton: I believe the proper word for this situation is “Bingo”.

Soldier: Well, to be more precise sir….

Darlton: Oh just call it and already, Mr. Literal.

Cornelia: Is that… Darlton?

Guilford: So, that’s where the main enemy base is located?

Cornelia: Right. We’ll be securing our position here.

Guilford: Are you sure about this?

Cornelia: I don’t need to steal achievements from my subordinates.
Send reserve force to back up Darlton.
Looks like he’ll be getting another medal.

Lelouch: Impressive as always Cornelia, a very logical deployment.
However excellent though it is, it’s also easy to read as is your location.

Jeremiah: I thought the reserve units were supposed to be assigned to General Darlton..

Villetta: That’s right, they were, but our unit has to secure the rear line of Viceroy Cornelia.

Jeremiah: You mean this is the rear line?
You can’t get any further away from the battlefield.
How am I going to redeem my reputation out here if I’m not even near the fighting?

Soldier: We’ve lost contact with Nakamura’s unit.

Soldier: No response from sector three.

Soldier: Major Tabata has been killed.

Soldier: Kurota and Kurata are gone, too.

Soldier: What about Nagai?

Katase: Where’s Tohdoh.
If only he were here the divine wind would blow.
We’d have another miracle of Itsukushima.

Soldier: Look out!

Asahina: Sir, don’t you think this is a little extreme?

Tohdoh: Asahina, Chiba, prep the custom Burais ASAP.
Tell Urabe and Senba behind us to do the same.
Traffic is blocked off all around Narita.
They’ve already begun to attack.
I just pray that we are in time.

Darlton: Now any resistance still remaining in Area 11…

Cornelia: … will soon be finished.

Lelouch: Right, all preparations have now been completed.
Black Knights. prepare to move out.

Soldier: Damn it, we have no choice.

Soldier: I don’t wanna die.

Soldier: We’ll make a miracle happen.

Soldier: Yeah, we’ll have Zero with us.

Lelouch: We the Black Knights are going to launch a surprise attack on the Britannians from the summit of the mountain.
Per my instructions, you will charge on most down toward point three.
And the intent of this operation is to capture Cornelia, second Princess of Britannia.
Our breakthrough route will be opened by the Guren Mk-II.
Kallen, use penetrating electrode number three, settle things with one blow.

Kallen: Got it.
Output confirmed.
Wave surger level is ready and holding.
Activating gun bullet now.

Kallen: It worked!

Soldier: Ooh… What’s happening?

Soldier: Is this an earthquake?

Soldier: At a time like this? Aah!

Soldier: What the hell?

Euphemia: What’s happening?

Soldier: Impossible. How could a landslide come out of nowhere.

Soldier: Alex and Darlton’s units are getting wiped out!

Soldier: Climb. Get to higher ground.

Cornelia: Status report.

Soldier: We’re still trying to confirm.

Guilford: Your highness, fall back. You’re in danger there.

Cornelia: I don’t care. Forget about me.
Find out about Darlton. and where’s Alex?

Soldier: Will this place hold together?

Soldier: This center area should make it through.

Lloyd: Oh my, at this rate they’ll be swept all the way to the bottom.

Cecile: These heat readings are abnormal.
Do you believe a hydrovolcanic eruption was artificially induced?

Lloyd: Impossible. Unless of course, someone’s used Rakshata’s Radiant Wave surger.

Suzaku: Hey, has something happened?

Lloyd: Aha. But it is has nothings to do with us.
So just relax and continue waiting.

Lelouch: Heh. It’s even more destructive than I anticipated.
We did succeed in isolating Cornelia’s unit but we could’ve been a bit more accurate.
Perhaps I should’ve consulted a physics teacher or ask Nina to tutor me in probability.

Soldier: New enemy force confirmed moving in from the summit.
Carius unit is moving to engage them.

Cornelia: Hoping to take advantage of all the confusion, are they?

Soldier: Emergency call from Carius unit.

Cornelia: What’s wrong?

Soldier: It’s not the Japan liberation Front, they think it’s the Black Knights.

Cornelia: What? Then it’s?

Jeremiah: Zero.
How dare he show up here, Zero!

Villetta: Lord Jeremiah, you can’t just abandon your post.

Jeremiah: This requires drastic measures.
If you want glory in life, then follow me!

Lelouch: Cornelia has only limited reinforcements headed her way. Smash right through them.

Soldier: Yeah, we can do this now.

Inoue: All right everybody? You know the game plan.
Our job is to watch their backs. Get ready? Fire!

Jeremiah: The enemy’s taken out Carius’s unit?
If I can finish this before Zero reaches Princess Cornelia, then I’ll be golden.

Villetta: Lord Jeremiah.

Jeremiah: Villetta you came. I knew that you would.

Lelouch: Burn the bridges behind you and keep your back to the wall.
Classical strategies remain effective ones, don’t they?

Jeremiah: Zero.

Soldier: Ugh, damn it.

Jeremiah: Is Zero here? If he is, then face me.
Come forward and fight Jeremiah Gottwald!

Lelouch: Well, well, it’s been a while Jeremiah. So you’re still in the army?
I’d love to stay and catch up but I’m afraid I don’t have time right this minute, Orange Boy.

Jeremiah: Orange?
Die!

Villetta: Lord Jeremiah.

Jeremiah: Stay out of this.
This is my duel.

Villetta: But look at it, I’ve never seen a Knightmare like that before.
Is it possible that the Elevens have…

Jeremiah: You think Elevens are capable of such technology?

Jeremiah: It’s fast.
This thing, is this what destroyed Carius’s unit?

Kallen: Yeah that’s right Britannia. We can finally go up against you on equal footing head on.
And our counter attack begins with this baby the Guren Mk-II…Uuugh!

Jeremiah: Oh hell! There’s something on its right hand.
But if I keep my distance?
What’s this?

Kallen: Sorry.

Jeremiah: Ah…
What– What the hell’s happening?!

Villetta: Lord Jeremiah, eject.

Jeremiah: I can’t run now. Zero’s right in front of me.
He’s standing right here. Damn it! The auto-eject! Don’t you dare activate!
I can still get Zero! I know it! I know I can still get him! Aah!

Kallen: I won’t lose! Not with this… Guren Mk-II!

Villetta: They defeated Lord Jeremiah! Who are the Black Knights? Who are they, these warriors?

Lelouch: All our tasks at hand have been cleared.
The pieces are in position.
The only thing left to do is check my opponent’s stronghold.

Cornelia: Uh…

Darlton: What are our losses?

Army: I’ve only got signal from 20% of our forces.

Darlton: 20%? Our command structure can’t sustain this.

Army: This is Marceau unit. I can’t raise General Alex.
It looks like the second division has been wiped out!

Suzaku: Lloyd, what’s going on?

Lloyd: Umm, it’s very unnatural.

Suzaku: Unnatural?

Lloyd: There seems to be an unconfirmed report that the Black Knights have appeared.

Suzaku: Zero…

Lloyd: Congratulations, this is our chance.

Suzaku: Lloyd.

Cecile: You’re so rash.

Lloyd: Whoa? Why is that?

Cecile: Would you like a detailed explanation?

Lloyd: Eeh, no, I will pass…
Anyway, while the high command’s still gathering data, all we can do is play by ear, right?

Army: Is the viceroy safe?

Army: Yes, she was outside the mud flow.
But the units guarding her flank were lost.
That means she’s totally isolated.

Army: What the hell are those Pure Bloods doing?

Kewell: C’mon, move! I can’t lose to Elevens.
I am a Britannian!

Villetta: Lord Kewell!!

Lelouch: All right.
Guren Mk-II, move to planned point.
We’ll break through the rest of their line and take Cornelia.

Kallen: Right.

Black Knights: Got it. Let’s pull this off.

Villetta: Fight to the death!

Sugiyama: Ugh…Aahh!

Tamaki: Sugiyama, you’re okay?

Sugiyama: Yeah…

Black Knights: Get them.

Lelouch: That’s right. Move swiftly.
If you survive this battle, you can call yourself a true warrior.
And afterward…

Army: The Pure Bloods are holding their ground?
Army: Yes sir. Under Lady Villetta’s command.
Army: Then use the moment for the viceroy to retreat. Send air cover.
Euphemia: No wait. Something’s approaching the viceroy from behind.
Tohdoh: All units, are you ready?
Four Holy Sword: Yes sir.
Tohdoh: All right. Deploy the custom Burais.
Four Holy Sword: Deploy.
Tohdoh: Listen carefully. If this landslide was manmade, it should allow us to hit Cornelia from behind.
Capture Cornelia now. Take revenge for what happened seven years ago.
Four Holy Sword: Yes sir. By the honor of the four holy swords.
Cornelia: What?
Guilford: Protect her highness.
Tohdoh: Surround them.
Cornelia: Japan Liberation Front?
Tohdoh: Slash and encircle!
Four Holy Sword: Right!
Tohdoh: These are not just any Burais.
Asahina: This reminds me of seven years ago.
Chiba: But it’s different now. This time we have Knightmares as well.
Guilford: Your highness, leave them to us. Please you have to withdraw for now.
Cornelia: Very well. I know a way to turn this around. Guilford.
Guilford: Yes.
Cornelia: After you drive them back, meet me over at point nine.
Guilford: Nine? I understand.
JLF: Cornelia!
Cornelia: You weaklings.

Villetta: All right. Keep this up and crash Zero!
Tamaki: Maybe we should get Kallen over here.
Lelouch: No, if we break formation now, our plan is ruined. This is turning grim.
If it goes on we’ll be fighting her royal guard next.
Kallen: Zero, Cornelia is under attack down below.
Lelouch: What’s that? Which team made the move.
Kallen: It’s not our people. Looks like the JLF.
Lelouch: Someone else understands my intent? How excellent.
They’ll hold off the royal guard which is just what we need.
Tohdoh: I’m sorry for the late arrival, general.
Katase: Tohdoh. We’ve been waiting.
Tohdoh: General, please send all remaining units to join me here.
Katase: Can you beat them?
Tohdoh: Yes. But only if we can hold off their main force. We have a chance now to turn the entire war around.
Guilford: I’ve heard area 11 has a formidable commander, their shining knight. Is this him? Tohdoh?
Fine. Let him try me.

Darlton: Umm… at a time like this?
Army: What do we do?
Darlton: Fall back! We have to find a way to link up with viceroy Cornelia.
Army: But sir. Their main base is right in front of us. And if we’re hit from behind we’ll be wiped out!
Darlton: You fool! If princess Cornelia is taken by these Elevens this entire battle is lost!
Army: Y..yes sir. whoaa.
Army: Sub-viceroy Euphemia you must act now to prevent disaster. Send in the G1!
Euphemia: No.
Army: But commander Guilford is completely pinned down. He can’t get to Cornelia.
Her life is at stake here.
Euphemia: We can’t. There’s a field hospital right here and civilians.
They’ve been evacuated from all over the area and brought to this point.
Besides, the G1 base is a command center. The viceroy ordered me not to move it
no matter what, that’s why … I just can’t.
Lloyd: Well, hello there. The ASEEC crew reporting for duty.
Army: Insolence!
Army: You are irregulars. Your orders are to keep silent and observe.
Cecile: Yes sir, normally we would but..
Lloyd: But all of this waiting around is boring.
Suzaku: Sub-viceroy Euphemia, I beseech you. Please order us into the battle.
Army: How transparent. You just want the glory of rescuing the viceroy.
Army: Our whole army is out there. You think one unit is going to change things with an Eleven pilot?
Lloyd: Right, right. But what’s the harm in trying? Since it’s just one unit it won’t look bad for you if we lose, right?
Are you listening?
Euphemia: Euphe? Yes I understand. Please do it.
Lloyd: We got it.
Cecile: Thank you very much.
Suzaku: Right. I won’t fail.

Tohdoh: Damn it. He’s fierce.
Tohdoh: Scatter!
Urabe: Lieutenant Colonel, what about Cornelia.
Tohdoh: If Zero’s the man I think he is, he’s moving into position right now. We’ve got to trust him.
Guilford: What? Zero’s on the move?
Villetta: Right. We’ll keep going and come over and back you up.
Guilford: Never mind that now. Just track Zero.
Villetta: Yes sir. This is his projected course.
Guilford: The princess was trying to trap Tohdoh. Now there’s a Knightmare waiting for her.
Princess Cornelia!
Cornelia: I got the message. Guilford.

Cécile:
Advanced weapon system Z01 Lancelot.
Utilize sand-panels to climb liquified slope at max combat speed and rescue the viceroy.
Suzaku:
Yes, my Lord.
Lloyd:
Suzaku, there’s one thing I want to ask you.
Suzaku:
What’s that?
Lloyd:
More than anything, you hate when people die.
Yet, you are in the military. Why is that?
Suzaku:
I’m in the military to stop people from dying.
Lloyd:
And that self-contradiction will get you killed someday.
Ugh, sorry about that.
Suzaku:
Lancelot, now launching…

Kallen:
Cornelia!
Cornelia:
Lowborn scum!
Kallen:
Ugh…!
Cornelia:
What’s this?
That’s not just a customized unit.
Zero:
Can you hear me, Cornelia.
This is checkmate.
Cornelia:
Zero.
Zero:
Yes. Should we cerebrate our reunion?
Of course, you’ll have to surrender to us first.
And after that, there are a few questions I want to ask you.
And in case you are wondering, your reinforcements won’t get here in time.
I win, Cornelia.
Cornelia:
You are a fool, Zero.
This one. If I take this one out, I’m free and clear!
You’ve got some moves!
Kallen:
Huh!
Cornelia:
Huh? Ugh!
Coward! Attacking from behind!
Zero:
Really?
And your own attack methods don’t show acts of cowardice?
Darlton:
Ugh…Aghhhhh…
They’ve launched a pincer assault before we could regroup.
I’ll never be able to reach the Princess now.
Villetta:
Aghhhhh!
Senba:
Lieutenant Colonel, we’ve crashed the enemy reinforcements.
Tohdoh:
Right. Switch to Spinning Life Or Death formation.
Four Holy Swords:
Yes, sir.
Guilford:
Ahh… If this goes on, Princess Cornelia will be…
Cornelia:
Guilford. Guilford, my knight.
You and Darlton protect Euphe.
Guilford:
Your highness!
Cornelia:
I won’t surrender.
As an imperial princess, I’ll fight to the last.
Guilford:
Agh… Princess Cornelia!!
Zero:
Huh. She is so predictable.

Zero:
Ugh…
Kallen:
Agh…
Cécile:
Oh my!
Lloyd:
As reckless as ever, eh?
He’s used the VARIS to clear the obstacles in his path.
Suzaku:
Viceroy, are you all right?
I came to help your Highness.
Cornelia:
Special Corp?
Who authorized you?
Guilford:
He can get her out of there.
If it is the Lancelot unit.
Tamaki:
Hey, isn’t that Knightmare…?
Ohgi:
Yeah. The one from Shinjuku and Lake Kawaguchi.
Zero:
Again?! It’s him again?!
Mk-II, destroy that unit immediately!
It’s interfered with us enough!
Kallen:
Right.
Suzaku:
Huh?
Cornelia:
You handle that thing.
I’ll take out Zero.
Kallen:
Now, you’ll pay for Shinjuku!
Suzaku:
Huh? It’s as fast as the Lancelot?
Kallen:
If I could take it down…
Is that all you’ve got?!
Suzaku:
Ugh…
Blocked?!
Kallen:
Ahhh…!
Ohgi:
Hey, are you OK?
Kallen:
I am.
Zero:
Ohgi!
Ohgi:
Yes.
Zero:
How’s the Guren Mk-ll?!
Ohgi:
The right hand is wrecked.
We’ve got to fix it.
Zero:
Grrrr… Retreat!
Ohgi:
Eh?
Zero:
All Black Knights move to your escape points.
This is becoming a war of attrition. Retreat!
Suzaku:
Viceroy?
Cornelia:
Go after Zero.
Suzaku:
But…
Cornelia:
My energy filler is just drained. Go!
Suzaku:
Right!
Tamaki:
Ughaghh… I’m hitting this retreat thing.
Ohgi:
We thrashed ’em. But if we kept pushing…
Tamaki:
Face it. We left the JLF there as bait but we ran away.
Kallen:
I hate it when you say it like that but…
Ohgi:
Yeah, but people aren’t just pieces in a chess game.
Zero wouldn’t think like that.
If he did, he’d end up using us as pawns, too.
I don’t believe he’d do that.
His rage is real. He hates Britannia as much as we do.
I think a person who knows rage also knows sorrow.
Zero:
Ughhh… Aghh…
Suzaku:
Special Corp head trailer, found Zero.
Going in for capture.

Suzaku: Zero, I owe you.
I know that you’ve saved a lot of people.
I know there’re lots of Elevens supporting you from the shadows.
However, your methods are very wrong.
Suzaku: That’s…
Is that the girl from the capsule in Shinjuku?
C.C.: Stop now.
Don’t even think about hurting him.
Lelouch: C.C.
Suzaku: She’s working with Zero?
Lelouch: Wait. What are you doing?
You are challenging a Knightmare?
C.C.: It’s a problem if you die.
It’ll be indirect contact but it’s worth a try.
Suzaku: Father.
You’re dead.
That’s impossible.
No, I didn’t mean to…
No, I, I just…
Lelouch: Hey, are you using Geass on him?
C.C.: I’m just feeding him some shock images, I can’t tell what he’s seeing, though.
Anyway, you’ve got time to get away now.
Lelouch: What about you?
C.C.: I can’t move yet.
You go first.
Lelouch: Don’t be foolish.
I can’t keep owning you favors.
C.C.: No, not now!
Lelouch: What?
This is different.
That’s…
C.C.: Stop. Stop it.
Stay out of my mind.
Stop it. No, I’m now…
You’re unveiling me.
Suzaku: I had to do it.
Lelouch: What’s happening to him?
C.C.: Idiot.
Get away now.
Lelouch: C.C.
C.C.: Hurry!

Chiba: Damn you!
Tohdoh: Don’t follow!
I have no idea what Zero is trying to do now.
Our only course of action is to get to the General and get him out of here.
Guilford: Your Highness, I’ll be right there.
Cornelia: Guilford, relay this message to all units.
Prepare to retreat.
There’s no reason to waste the lives of any more of my men.
Stay in formation and fall back cautiously.
We have to face facts. We’ve been defeated this time.
Tamaki: You see, Britannia sure had its hands full just dealing with the Liberation Front.
Ohgi: Yeah, that gave us the chance we needed to escape.
Kallen: Hey, where is Zero?
I can’t raise his Burai.
You don’t think he’s been captured, do you?

Lelouch: This girl, she can’t be human.
She recovers from wounds in ways that are beyond normal.
She was shot in head in Shinjuku and yet…
Clovis confined her for his private experiments so she is not connected with Britannia.
Her vital signs are at human levels.
I’d better analyze the blood sample later and photograph the wounds.
What?
(dripping)
C.C.: You finally called me by my real name.
(dripping)
Cornelia: So, Zero escaped again.
Guilford: The Japan Liberation Front hammered our defenses and he slipped away in the confusion.
Cornelia: Despicable. Using someone else to cover his movements.
Oh, what about Kururugi?
Guilford: He is safe now.
We had to wait till his energy filler run out to finally stop him.
Cornelia: Stop him from what?
Was there a problem with his unit?
Guilford: Apparently, it was going berserk.
Guilford: A failure unworthy of my older brother’s forces.
Lelouch: I removed the shrapnel and cleaned the wound.
C.C.: That wasn’t necessary.
Lelouch: Apparently not.
C.C.: So there was no point in protecting me at all.
Your pride always gets in the way at the most ridiculous moments.
Lelouch: But then I learned something from it.
(dripping)
Lelouch: That’s your name, isn’t it?
C.C.: You have a bad habit of eavesdropping.
Lelouch: Well, it’s a good name.
It’s a lot more human than C.C.
C.C.: Oh, that’s a joke as if I want to be more human.
After all, I, I…
I’ve forgotten everything, every single thing.
So what’s the use of it?
A name?
But why…?
(dripping)
Lelouch: It’s a good time to say this.
Yes, you saved me today.
You did that before and then gave me Geass.
That’s why I’ll only say this once.
Thank you.
C.C.: No one’s ever thanked me before.
Well then, can you show your appreciation?
Say it again like you did before.
Lelouch: Oh, you mean the name.
C.C.: Just this once with tenderness like you treasure it in your heart.
Lelouch: Very well then.
(dripping)
Lelouch: How was that?
C.C.: It was bad.
It was completely bad.
It wasn’t tender.
There was no honesty or sympathy in it.
You spoke it oddly and worst of all, it was cold.
Lelouch: You’re a picky girl.
C.C.: Exactly. That’s why I go by the name C.C.

Soldier: Ughh… Another soldier.
Soldier: No wonder our battalions fell apart.
Jeremiah: I swear I’m not Orange. Zero!
Lelouch: Looks like our ride’s here.
Kallen: Zero, are you OK?
The others went on ahead and… Who’s that?
Lelouch: Oh, you needn’t worry.
She’s a very important friend.
C.C., I don’t know why snow is white.
But I still think snow is beautiful.
I don’t hate it.
C.C.: I see.

Minister: The Japan Liberation Front was nearly wiped out by your Narita operation, viceroy.
Now, we’re hunting down the survivors, one by one.

Cornelia: Are you being sarcastic?
We’re barely pulling our forces back together after that fiasco.

Minister: No, I, I didn’t mean to…

Guilford: The Occupation Government is responsible for this.
They’ve done nothing about Area 11’s subways and mining railways.
In the ghettoes, they falsify the registries and property deeds as the rebellion spreads unchallenged.

Minister: Ah, the subway tunnels stretch over the whole country.
We can’t just fill them all in.
We don’t have the budget.

Guilford: The terrorists are using them as their strike bases and escape routes.

Minister: B,,, But, Prince Clovis instructed us.
Ah, he said forcing them would fuel the rebellion giving the Chinese Federation an excuse to attack.

Cornelia: They’ve already got their excuse.
Zero is growing stronger and bolder everyday.

Darlton: Vice-Minister. Internal Affairs has appointed special group of the Elevens to self-govern this area, isn’t that right?
A group who are called the NAC.

Minister: Huh?

Darlton: When we stormed Narita, we looked for the evidence of the NAC’s conspiracies.
But it was buried in the landslide. Still our suspicions remain high.
If we suppress them now…

Cornelia: Hmm, a group of blue-bloods and plutocrats. Relics of their dismal past.

Minister: Oh, wait! please!
These are just rumors.
There’s no evidence of that at all.
If you suppress them, then the Eleven’s economy will certainly collapse.
That means no tax revenue to send to the homeland.
Also, it’s a prime directive of the empire that Numbers should take care of their own kind.

Cornelia: And what have you done to find the Black Knights?

Minister: We analyzed the shield machine they left showing Zero was behind the Narita operation.
But that’s all we’ve got. You can’t squeeze information out of corpses.

Cornelia: So you can’t catch Zero and you don’t want us to hit Kyoto.
Do you know the word incompetent, minister?
It’s for people who can’t get results.

Kirihara: So, the Britannian viceroy has gone this far already.

Man: With the Liberation Front smashed, the last embers of Japan have died away.

Man: No, he may be on the run, but Tohdoh is still strong, still fighting.

Man: Even if that so, I heard he lost his custom Burais. So, there’s no hope.

Kaguya: There is hope.

Man: Mm?

Man: The Black Knights?
You’ve been infatuated with Zero since he rescued Suzaku Kururugi.
We even sent him the Guren Mk-II.

Teacher: And after the defeat at Trafalgar, Elisabeth the third found herself surrounded by revolutionaries in Edinburgh.

Shirley: Oh, father…

Teacher: However with the help of Lord Britannia, she’s fled to the American colonies now known as our homeland Britannia.

Shirley: Hmm… Um… H’m… Ha…

Milly: Huh? OK. What’s got you so worried.
Constipated? Your monthly?

Shirley: Huh? That’s not it.

Milly: Huh… You’re lonely ’cause Lelouch is gone, aren’t you?

Shirley: Wha… It’s more like Kallen is absent the same day he is… again.

Milly: Oh, so carefree.
While the rest of the world grapples with what happened at Narita.
Suzaku’s been out for two days because of that, too.

Shirley: I know that! But Lelou and Kallen gone on the same day together. That’s serious.

Milly: He he he! I envy you, Shirley.
That’s what I love about you.

Nina: Huh?

Shirley: Don’t make fun of me!

Arthur: Meow.

Milly: Then just tell him already, three little words “I like you!”.

Shirley: Uh… Uh… I couldn’t. I just couldn’t.
I mean what if…

Milly: What if he rejects me, it can ruin our great friendship.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

Shirley: You don’t have to laugh that hard, you know?

Milly: It’s comfortable isn’t it?
This place now. The way we are together.

Shirley: That’s true.

Milly: Still we should prepare ourselves a bit.
The fact is nothing stays the same forever, you know.

Shirley: Uh…

Milly: Oh, forget it. Please don’t take me too seriously.
If it’s bothering you why not you just ask him the next chance you get?
So, how do you feel about it on your side?

Shirley: Huh? Wha… Lelou?!
I thought you were absent!

Lelouch: Nunnally had a little fever this morning and Sayoko was busy.
So, I stayed home to help.

Shirley: Oh really, you don’t say.
So, is Nunna feeling better now?

Lelouch: A bit. Madam president, those papers?

Milly: All right.
Make sure you organize all of them by year and class, OK?

Lelouch: Yeah, I will.
You have a talent for ordering people around.

Milly: He he.
And you are a great subordinate.

Lelouch: Subordinate?
Huh, I guess that’s what I am.

Shirley: Oh, madam president!
You nearly gave me a heart attack doing that!
Huh?! Oh, where is my tickets? HUH!!
Lelou!

Lelouch: What is it?

Shirley: Ah… Um…
Is my dad’s letter mixed up with that paperwork?

Lelouch: Huh? Oh, sorry.
Huh? What’s wrong?

Shirley: Ah! Lelou!

Lelouch: Shirley?

C.C.: Ah? Stop being so suspicious. That’s hardly the case.
To me, he is nothing more than a …

Shirley: Ah huh huh huh hu…
I did it! I actually really did it!
So, now what happens? He’ll come, right?
I mean he didn’t say no. Then again…
N-n, he is just coming with me to a little concert.
So, it’s not big thing but still it’s a chance.
Huh… Thank you, father.
Ah?

Ohgi: Kyoto praised us for using the Guren Mk-II so well.
I thought that was encouraging.

Kallen: But there was the white armor.

Tamaki: Don’t sweat it. It was a tie, right?
A tie! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! A-ha-ha-ha-ha!

Lelouch: Why would Shirley just out of the blue?

Shirley: My dad works where really long away from here.
But he likes to send me great staff like this to keep my spirits up, you know?
So, I was just wondering…

Ohgi: Here.

Lelouch: Hmm? What’s this?

Ohgi: A love letter.

Lelouch: Oh? From you?

Tamaki: A-ha-ha-ha-ha!
And they say you have no sense of humor.
A-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

Kallen: You laugh too much.

Ohgi: It’s an official letter form Kyoto.
They urgently request a meeting.

Lelouch: Is this really such a big deal?

Kallen: A big deal?! It’s Kyoto!

Ohgi: If they accept us it means funding and support.
It could solve our financial crisis.

Lelouch: Crisis?!

Ohgi: Ugh…!

Lelouch: There shouldn’t be any problem if you are following the budget I laid out.

Ohgi: Oh, well…

Tamaki: Hey! It’s not my fault!
We’re turning into a big organization now!
That means new expenses, you know!

Kallen: Like French dinners for the new recruits so you can show off?

Tamaki: Hey, you?!

Kallen: I know where you’ve been taking them, big spender?

Tamaki: Uh-ugh?! You know about it?!

Lelouch: Huh… We’ll put Ohgi in charge of the treasury for now.

Tamaki: Hold it right there!
I’m the one that’s in charge of the cash!
That’s my job!

Lelouch: If you want me to trust you then show me some results.

Tamaki: Did you actually just say trust a guy who hides his face from his own partners?!

Sugiyama: Huh?

Tamaki: How about it Zero, Huh?!

Ohgi: Hold on… That’s a…

Kallen: Zero is not the problem here. Who cares who he is?
He had the skill to outwit Cornelia, didn’t he?
That’s why he is the leader of the Black Knights.
Do you really need to know more?

Tamaki: Gee…!

Nunnally: Nina? Is that you?
If you are not feeling well, then…

Nina: Oh no. It’s nothing.
Don’t worry about it.

Tamaki: Huh… So, what do we do?

Ohgi: I don’t know.

Minami: We were in Naoto’s unit.

Sugiyama: I don’t mind about his kid sister Kallen but…

Tamaki: You were next in line to be leader.

Ohgi: No one said that at Narita.

Inoue: ‘Cause Zero practically forced us.

Yoshida: We are the senior commanders and he keeps secrets from us.

Ohgi: Huh…

Lelouch: I’ve narrowed it down to twelve possibilities.
Now let’s see which bets pay off.
For that I’ll have to meet them face to face…

(knock-knock)

Lelouch Hm? Who is it?

Kallen: It’s me.
Um… I’m sorry if I was out of line when I spoke up back there.

Lelouch: Kallen, tell me.
Do you wanna know my identity as well?

Kallen: Hmm… That girl knows, doesn’t she…?
Hmm… No, sorry to bother you.

Nunnally: Lelouch?

Lelouch: Huh…! Huh…
Looks like your fever’s gone?

Nunnally: Maybe I was just a little moody.

Lelouch: Moody?

Nunnally: Huh… It just seems to me lately that you’ve become a little distant like you have other things weighing on your mind.

Lelouch: Huh…!

Nunnally: Huh. Perhaps my body just did this on its own to get your attention.
Huh.

Lelouch: You’re wrong. I haven’t changed.
No matter what, I’ll always be at your side, Nunnally.

Nunnally: So then, can I be a little selfish now?
Please hold my hand just a little bit longer.
If I fall asleep alone, I’m afraid I’ll have that dream again.

C.C.: You are serious?
You are asking me for a favor?

Lelouch: Yes, I got the idea from something that you said.
No matter what Kyoto’s intentions are I want their power.

C.C.: Is that what you truly wish for?
If it’s at the very core of your reason for living then I’ll try to help you.

Lelouch: Then do it.
C.C., I need you.

C.C.: Hmm, I understand.
By the way, you forgot something.

Lelouch: Huh?! I didn’t forget!
I don’t know when I’ll be back tonight so I was planning to call her and cancel.

C.C.: Stick to your contract. Huh?

(Pi-Pi-Pi-Pi-Pi)

Lelouch: It’s me.
Oh good timing, I wanted to call. You see…

Shirley: Um… Listen, Lelou?

Lelouch: Huh?

Shirley: I know I made a date with you but I may be late.

Lelouch: Huh…

Shirley: Sorry, but anyway, I’m sure it’ll be fine, really.
Hmm, but I promise you that I’ll be there.

Man: Please bring your command staff along as for my master’s instruction, understood?

Lelouch: They are patrolling the perimeter in case of any unpleasant contingencies.
I’ll call them soon.
However before I do…

Britannian Army: Severely damaged corpses should be brought to tent 2.
Id [your ?] personal items.
Bring remains with identifiable faces to tent 1.
Note locations and times.

Britannian Army: Medical team 2 will arrive [and not tech support ?].
Transport personnel, report to tent 2.

Suzaku: Was it really her?
Did I really see her there?
And then… Just forget it.
She doesn’t show up in any of the data.

Lloyd: Dug enough bodies out of the landslide, yet?

Suzaku: Hmm… I’d like to continue recovery operation if that’s possible.

Lloyd: Be my guest till it’ll out of your system.
Considering Princess Cornelia is pleasure to indulge you.

Suzaku: Hmm…
Ah, Lloyd, Zero and the Black Knights what are they trying to do?
What do they hope to achieve by sacrificing all these lives?

Lloyd: They are knights for justice, haven’t you heard?

Suzaku: Is this justice?

Lloyd: Hey hey, I hope you are not going to start spouting some embarrassing theory about the nature of justice.
We are soldiers, after all.

Suzaku: Huh. Hmm?

Cecile: Oh Suzaku, I replaced the energy filler for you.

Suzaku: Ah… OK.

Lloyd: Cecile.

Cecile: I checked the units including the purebloods.

Lloyd: And I was right, wasn’t I?

Cecile: Yes, a radiant surge.

Lloyd: Rakshata.
I never thought she’d work with our enemies.

Cecile: Plus their pilot was extremely skilled. Suzaku’s mental status is so unstable now. If we have to fight that Knightmare again…

Lloyd: You don’t think it could win? Against my dear Lancelot?

Tamaki: This is taking too long.
When do we get there?

Kallen: Ah, could you chill out?
You are embarrassing.

Tamaki: Hm. What the hell?

Kallen: We are going up?

Man: Sorry for the inconvenience.
The master is waiting for you.

Sugiyama: Huh…!

Tamaki: Wow…!

Ohgi: This is… the Fuji mines?

Tamaki: That is not possible.
There’s no way we could be here.

Kallen: It has to be Mt.Fuji! There is only one mountain like this.

Tamaki: That means the Sakuradite is right below us?
The damn treasure that caused this whole war.
You know, what they do to intruders here? Execute them!

Ohgi: The power of which is all the way up to here? Kyoto group is amazing.

Kirihara: It’s repulsive.
Mount Fuji, a sacred mountain once known for its clear water and quiet beauty.
Now it is bent to the empire’s will, a place of hideous violation.
Our reflection of what Japan has become.
It [plings ?] me so.
I apologize for not showing my face.
But, Zero, your face is hidden as well.
Unfortunately, I cannot allow this.
To trust you, I must know who you are.
Therefore you will show me your face.

Kallen: Please wait! Zero has given us power and victory.
That should be…

Kirihara: Silence! Now which of you is Ohgi?

Ohgi: Huh…! That’s me.

Kirihara: You will remove Zero’s mask.

Kallen: Ohgi!

Ohgi: I’m sorry Zero, but we need a reason to put our faith in you, too.
So help us to put our trust in you.

Tamaki: Huh?! A woman?

Ohgi: It can’t be!

Kallen: It’s not! This isn’t Zero. I saw her before.
She was with Zero after Narita.

Kirihara: You there, girl, is this true?

C.C.: It is.

Kirihara: So you are not Japanese?

C.C.: Correct, clan chief of Kyoto, Taizo Kirihara.

Man: Huh!? Anyone who can identify him must die.

Man: Especially one who is not Japanese!

Tamaki: Hey, hold on! I’m not part of this!

Lelouch: You are soft and your methods and thinking are out dated. That is why you’ll never win!

Kallen: Zero?

Man: When did you…? Huh!

Man: Hold on! He can fire at us with that remote.
Everyone, stay back! Don’t make a move!

Lelouch: Taizo Kirihara, founder of Kirihara Industry which has monopoly on Sakuradite mine,
formerly a key backer of the Kururugi regime.
However, when Japan fell, you dodged the tribunals by collaborating with the colonial rulers.
Commonly known as Kirihara the traitor.
In reality, you are one of the leaders of the Six Houses Of Kyoto,
who support resistance groups throughout Japan, a double agent.
How cliche.

Man: Show some respect, you swine!

Kirihara: Stop!

Lelouch: N-Hu-Hu-Hu…
It’s as you guessed though, I am not Japanese!

Tamaki: Is he serious?
No wonder he never showed his face.

Kirihara: If you are not Japanese, why do you fight for Japan?
What is it that you want?

Lelouch: The destruction of Britannia.

Kirihara: And so, do you believe that this is possible, that you can do it?

Lelouch: I can, because I must.
I have reasons which compel me execrably.
I’m glad I’m dealing with you.

Kirihara: You…

Lelouch: It’s been a long time, Lord Kirihara.

Kirihara: Is it really you?
It’s eight years since I finally received you as a hostage.

Lelouch: Yes.
And I appreciate you taking care of me then.

Kirihara: If I hadn’t come tonight, were you planning to take our messengers as hostages?

Lelouch: Not at all.
I came to ask for your help.
That’s all I’m seeking from you.

Kirihara: So the flower planted eight years ago has finally bloomed.

Tamaki: I can’t see him!

Kirihara: Ohgi!

Ohgi: Yes!

Kirihara: This man is a true model enemy of Britannia.
His face must remain hidden for vital reasons.
I urge you to follow Zero.
And I guarantee that if you do, we will assist you generously with intelligence and strategic support.

Ohgi: We thank you.

Lelouch: I am grateful, Lord Kirihara.

Kirihara: Are you embarking on the path of blood?

Lelouch: Indeed, if that is my destiny.

Villetta: Yes, the spelling of Fenette matches this one.
I’m afraid this is him.
I’m sorry you had to learn about it like this.

Shirley’s mother: It’s all right…

Man: Can you please identify the body?

Lelouch: Of course, it’s too late already.
Anyway, things are finally moving forward.
Now the Black Knights will operate as I envisioned.

Lelouch: I’m sorry I was late.
I thought you’d already be back home by now.
Anyway, never mind that.
Come on, let’s go some place to get out of the rain now.

Shirley: Lelou, tell me.
Zero, he fights for the weak, doesn’t he?

Lelouch: What?
Yeah, well, that’s what he says.

Shirley: Then, then… why did he kill my father?
You know my father.
He was so gentle.
He never ever hurt me.
He didn’t do anything wrong.
But he was buried alive.
He couldn’t… breath… why… why did my father have to die?
I… don’t want this.
No…
Please, Lelou… help me.

Priest: He was a pious soul who is always looked to God in his life and friend to us all.
To his wife he was a devoted husband, to his child a loving father.

Shirley: Father…

Priest: May he rest in peace forever cradled in the bosom of our Lord.

Shirley’s mother: No, stop! Don’t bury him again, please. He suffered enough. Oh God, don’t leave me.

Shirley: Mom, he’s gone already. Please Mom.

Shirley: Guess what Papa? Someday when I grow up, I’m gonna be your wife.

Shirley’s father: Oh that’s very sweet of you honey.
But your teacher told you, didn’t she? Someday you’ll meet the man you really love.

Shirley: More than I do you?

Shirley’s father: Hum… It’s hard to explain.
Well, if you truly love that person and he cares for you just as much, it would make me the happiest father on earth.

Kallen: Shirley, I’m so sorry this happened.

Shirley: Oh, stop. What have you to apologize for?

Rivalz: We feel awful.
It just that… when we were all watching the hotel jacking on TV, I thought the Black Knights were… you know, heroes.
I mean the news was handling it all wrong, anyway I was posting online how I thought what happened in Narita was kinda cool, and I…
Forgive me.

Shirley: Come on! Don’t be silly. That has absolutely nothing to do with this at all.
I mean even I was saying Narita was…

Milly: Shirley, stop. Seriously, I’m starting to worry about you here.
Have you cried yet? If you simply hold it in, It’s only going to be harder for you later on.

Shirley: You don’t have to worry. Really, I’m fine.
I’ve cried a lot.

Suzaku: Cowards, Zero and his people. Their methods are just cowardly.
He doesn’t even get his hands dirty.
He stirs people into a frenzy, tips the world into chaos, and then sits back and congratulates himself.
It’s not going to change a thing.
Anything gained through his kind of tactics is just meaningless.

Milly: Well, anyway, I think it’s time we headed back, everyone.
Shirley, we’ll be waiting for you, back in the old student council room, same as ever.
…
Come on guys, let’s go.

Rivalz: Hey, Lelouch!
What? What I do..

Shirley: Lulu, forgive me.

Lelouch: What?

Shirley: It wasn’t fair. Kissing you like that. It wasn’t fair of me at all.
It was just… something I did. Forget about it, okay?
I shouldn’t have put you on the spot like that.
I’m sorry. It was totally stupid of me.
I mean, you finally kissed me, and I can’t even be happy.

Lelouch: Wait! Shirley.

C.C.: Do you regret it?
That your friend’s father was caught up in all this?
You were just accusing Kirihara of being too soft.
What happened to the path of blood?

Lelouch: Shut up.

C.C.: But it turns out you’re the soft one.
Did you think this was all just a game?
You’ve already killed your fair share of people. By hand, or words more often than not.

Lelouch:Just shut up.

C.C.: All of them left behind a family.
All had lovers and friends.
Are you really telling me you hadn’t grasped that yet?
I would have thought you to be better prepared.

Lelouch: Just shut up. I am prepared.
I have been from the moment I killed Clovis.

C.C.: Then why this hesitation?
Has she shaken you so badly?
One kiss and you go to pieces then, huh?
So for all your preening and posturing, you’re really just a spoiled little boy with a swollen head and a big fat mouth.
…
You ran way too deep to be turning back now. You’ve passed the point of no return.
You need a reason for living, don’t you?
You’re not going to disappoint me, are you?

Charles: Yes, that is why people discriminate against one another.

Euphemia: So, is that the reason why you killed my brother.

Suzaku: And any ends gained through contemptible means aren’t worth anything.

Ohgi: Are you really going through with this?

Kallen: That’s all easy enough to say, isn’t it?

Clovis: You can’t! We may have different mothers, but you and I are still blood.

Suzaku: It’s nothing but self-satisfying gratification.

C.C.: And to have this Utopia you’d…

Nunnally: I wish the world was a gentler place.

C.C.: You appear to have a reason for living.

Lelouch: And I’ve come back to change everything.

Kirihara: Are you embarking on the path of blood?

Lelouch: Ohgi, it’s me, Zero.

Lloyd: I have some bad news, Suzaku.
We’ve just got word from Cornelia’s Royal Guard.
We’re on deck for the next operation.
Are they acknowledging your skill or do they need another decoy?

Cecile: Oh Lloyd, care for another lesson in proper social etiquette?
You look like you have some time to kill.

Lloyd: Oh, I’ll have to take a pass on that.
Now then I believe we’re talking about your mission.

Ohgi: Wait a second, Zero.
I realize this is a request from Kyoto. I think we can definitely handle it.
And I’m pretty sure that Japan Liberation Front would rather join with us than flee to foreign soil in all. But…

Zero: You are the one who brought us this information. Diethard, wasn’t it?

Diethard: That’s right. It is an honor that you’d meet me like this, Zero.

Zero: So, princess Cornelia’s going to deploy the Royal Marines on General Katase at the Japan Liberation Front, is that correct?

Diethard: Yes. The network was already poised to broadcast a special report on it.

Zero: Lieutenant General Tohdoh will never make it Katase in time.
Which means that Japan Liberation Front has no military strength right now.
Their only chance of escape is the liquid Sakuradite they’re carrying.

Ohgi: Which is why we should help General Katase escape instead of going after Cornelia.

Zero: Ohgi, who are we?

Ohgi: W… we are the Black Knights, Zero.

Zero: Then we have but one task. We will destroy Cornelia’s troops.
And in doing so, rescue the remnants of the JLF.
Tonight, we regain what was lost to us at Narita.

Ohgi: What are the chances?

Zero: Need you ask?

Ohgi: Understood.

Diethard: Hmm.

Zero: Begin preparations. You all have your orders to carry out.

Kallen: Uh… Zero.

Zero: I have something to attend to. Whatever it is, save it for later.

Darlton: Just so you know, the viceroy has reservations about using the numbers.
But “Use every able body”, I always say, even if it’s the son of the former prime minister.
…
Our target is Katase. Take him out and the Japan Liberation Front is finished.
We are sending in a Royal Marines.
Your job will be to provide supporting fire from the shore until the marines have Katase.
As well as annihilating any stragglers left over.

Suzaku: Uh… I’m to annihilate them, sir?

Darlton: Nobody but the target is to survive. Is that clear?

Suzaku: Uh…

Darlton: Warrant officer Kururugi, show your loyalty to the crown.
This is your chance to get ahead in the world, soldier.

Suzaku: Understood, my Lord.

Lloyd: Onward, Christian soldiers? Conflicting morals, right?

Shirley: No, Lulu… It can’t be true.
He would never get tangled up with someone like that.

Villetta: There is a possibility that this boy is link to the Black Knights.

Shirley: What’re you saying he’s involved?

Villetta: In terrorism.

Shirley: I don’t believe you.
It can’t be… It has to be a lie!
…
Lulu… I’m so sorry to be doubting you like this. But…
Please… I wanna believe in you.

Villetta: Dammit, she lost him.
She’d just called me sooner, I could’ve had him.
I should’ve grabbed him when I had the chance… No, I need proof.
If he talks to her, I can learn what his roll is in all this.
Which is all the more important if he can manipulate memory somehow.
I won’t have to die, striped of my position and honor like Jeremiah.
Hell, this is the chance to move back up again.
So I have to find out a link to Zero.
It has to be me.

Lelouch: Who is there?

Kallen: I… I’m sorry, I’ll go.

Lelouch: Second thoughts?

Kallen: I thought that the goal was justice.
The only reason I’ve fought until now is because I thought it was the right thing to do.
So I could live with the killing, but now…
Tell me. Is this real?
Is what we are all doing here really going to change the world for the better?

Lelouch: Yes, it will, or rather it must change the world.
Will there be sacrifices? Not only just soldiers but the innocent as well.
And yet, because of all these things, we have no choice but to continue on.
No matter the cost, even if people see us as cowards, we have to prevail.
If that means more blood will be shed, so be it.
We’ve spilled so much to get here.
I can’t let it be in vain.
But I won’t force you, Kallen.
If you wish to turn back, now is the time.

Kallen: I’ve made my choice.
I’ll follow you to the very end.

Lelouch: I’m grateful, Kallen.

Lelouch: Yes, you saved me today. Thank you.
C.C. I need you. I do.

C.C.: What am I doing?
I just can’t afford to make the same mistake here all over again.

Darlton: It’s time.

Cornelia: Commence the operation!

Soldier: All underwater units, hit the water!
Dive! Dive! Dive!

Soldier: Special team, you’re clear for category C1 weaponry.

Soldier: Our unit will be covering them from the shore.
Careful though, we want that tanker in one piece.

Suzaku: Understood, my Lord.

Soldier: Once torpedo attack is confirmed, all units go to weapons free.
Repeat, weapons free.

Shirley: Oh my God. Terrorists?

Ohgi: It looks like it’s started. Zero, you wanna move out or what? Hey?
Do you read me? They’re closing in on the JLF. Come in. 「おい、聞こえてるんだろ？　日本解放戦線を・・・」

Lelouch: We have to hold. Cornelia moves faster than expected.
If we go now, we’ll die along with them.

Britannia: Commence support fire.
All units restricted to micro round ordinance only.
Be careful not to set off that liquid Sakuradite!

JLF: Damn those Britannians! When the hell did they get here?
Enemy units! They’re coming from the water… Ah!

JLF: Itagaki… Ah!

Britannia: 2-0-2, 5-0-3, focus fire at 9 o’clock.

Suzaku: This isn’t battle. This is wholesale slaughter.

Cecile: Officer Kururugi.

Suzaku: Go ahead.

Cecile: I certainly know this must be hard for you. But you are a soldier, remember that.

Suzaku: Right, I understand.

Katase: How could they’ve found us? Where is Tohdoh?

JLF: We can’t locate him, or the Holy Swords.

Katase: What about Kyoto!? They said they would send help.

JLF: Yes sir! But we have no way of contacting them now!

Katase: So they’re just gonna sit back and watch us die here?

JLF: We surrender! Please cease fire! This is the Japan Liberation Front!
I repeat we surrender!

Suzaku: Sir, they’re issuing a surrender over an open channel.

Britannia: Ignore it.

Suzaku: Yes. But sir…

Britannia: You see? They’re just buying time. Now, carry out your orders!

Shirley: Lulu just couldn’t be a member of the Black Knights, could he?

Ohgi: Dammit! It’ll be too late soon!
When does Zero plan to move?

Diethald: I just hope that he isn’t doing all these to honor some childish notion of justice.

Ohgi: The knightmare are boarding the ship!

Lelouch: I see… That leaves only one way out. They have to be careful around their precious Sakuradite.

Ohgi: Zero! If we don’t hurry…

Lelouch: Very well then, go ahead.

Katase: What the hell is going on….?

Cornelia: I can’t believe this idiocy! They blew up the liquid Sakuradite?

Lelouch: Just what you’d expect of the JLF, choosing to take the Britannians out with them.

Ohgi: Suicide? But they never mentioned.

Lelouch: We’re going to rush Cornelia’s position head-on!
Forget about everything else.
All that matters is achieving our goal.
If you want to avenge the JLF, then capture Cornelia.
And show them our strength and determination.

Kallen: Right.

Ohgi: This is like Narita all over again.

Diethald: It’s outstanding!

Ohgi: Hey, get back here!

Diethald: The JLF was just a bait. Their command is wide open now. One of the oldest tricks in the book.

Ohgi: Where are you going? Hey!

Diethald: It makes perfect sense!
He want to cripple his enemy’s defenses using the Liberation Front as a living trap!
He’s excellent materia, this Zero! He’s chaos incarnate!
More, show me more of your genius! Let your ego engulf the world!
Hahahaha! HAHAHAHA!

「こうでなければ！
解放戦線を囮に、手薄になった本隊に攻め入る？ふん、定石だがそれではいまひとつ弱い。
そうだ！どうせなら敵の戦力を削ぎ落とす！役立たずの解放戦線を生きたトラップとして！
やはりゼロは素晴らしき存在！カオスの権化だ！
もっと、もっと、見せてくれ、私に！あなたの主観に満ちた世界を！
フフハハハハハ！」

Britannia: Enemy attack!?

Britannia: 2-0-4 signal lost!
Erickson, form up with 3-0-8! Provide support!
All unit, Status report!
I repeat, What is your status!?

Suzaku: Why would General kill himself? It doesn’t make any sense.
Ah.. the main force! Could they use the tanker as a decoy?

Darlton: Mount up now! And form a defensive of line, on the double!

Cornelia: How did they know we were here!?

Guilford: Your highness!

Lelouch: Knock their Knightmares into the sea before the pilots can mount!
Guren Mk-II, you’re with me!

Kallen: Yes sir!

Guilford: Your highness, we can handle this.

Cornelia: Quiet! How many times you think I’ll allow them to mock me!?
…
I haven’t even powered on!
…
Do you think you can best me in Knightmare combat!?
…
That new model again?

Lelouch: I’ll smash your hatch and drag you out, Cornelia!
…
Shirley!?

Suzaku: Zero, your methods are not going to change anything.
You focused on goals, and don’t understand the pain of others.

Kallen: Zero!

Cornelia: This is payback for Narita.

Lelouch: Well, if it is that knight in shinning armor?

Suzaku: These are people’s lives you’re playing with. You’re nothing but a murderer!

Lelouch: Why! Why do you keep getting in my way?

Suzaku: Why do you keep spilling people’s blood without meaning?

Lelouch: If it wasn’t for you!

Suzaku: Because of you!

Suzaku: Zero, this is the end result.

Cornelia: Lancelot, behind you!

Kallen: Get the hell away from him!

Shirley: Is this Zero’s? So then with this…
I will pay you for my father!

Suzaku: No, wait!

Darlton: Do not pursue! Protecting the viceroy has top priority!

Ohgi: Zero, come in! Zero!

C.C.: Ohgi? Is that you? It’s C.C.

Ohgi: Yes. How’s Zero doing?

C.C.:
He’s OK, but he can’t move now.
Order a retreat. If we drag this out, we’ll be slaughtered.

Ohgi: Uh, yes, I understand. Got it.

Diethald: Hmm?

C.C.: Is that what you wanted?

Lelouch: Uh… Yes.

C.C.: This is pathetic.
You’re so shook up you can’t even issue orders, and Cornelia will…

Lelouch:
Listen to me.　My handgun is missing.
Whoever has it now must have taken it from me when I was unconscious.

C.C.:
If that’s true… it means they saw your face.

Lelouch:
There were at least two of them.
One who fired and one who got shot. Two…

Girl student:
Shirley? What are you doing up so early?
Is that a letter?

Shirley: It’s a… Oh, it’s nothing.

Girl student: I bet it’s a love letter, huh? Something special for Lelouch?

Shirley: In a way…

Suzaku: You want to meet Princess Euphemia?

Nina: To thank her. I just wanted to thank her.

Milly:
She risked her life to protect Nina during the hotel jacking.
She stood right up and said “I’m Euphemia!” Right?

Rivalz: Really? I want to meet her, too!

Milly: Why is that?

Rivalz: She’s a real princess! I could marry into royalty!

Nunnally: I’m sure that you will never meet her with such impure motives.

Rivalz:
Impure? That’s a little harsh, isn’t it, Nunnally?
You’re on my side, aren’t you, Madam Pre…

Milly:
Don’t kiss up to me just because Lelouch isn’t hanging around.
Nunnally saw right through you, and so do I.

Nunnally: Anyway, I’d like to meet Princess Euphemia, too, if I could.

Suzaku: Uh…

Milly: Huh?

Nunnally: Oh, what’s the matter, Suzaku?

Suzaku: Uh, It’s just she’s a member of the royal family and…

RRRRRRR

Suzaku: Hello, Ashford Academy student council.
Huh?

Lelouch: Suzaku?

Suzaku: Lelouch?

Lelouch: Is there anything unusual there?

Suzaku: Yeah, there is. You’re not here.

Lelouch: Oh, right.

Suzaku:
Shirley didn’t show up, either, by the way.
You know, Lelouch, you’ve been cutting classes lately.
You need to take school more seriously.

Lelouch:
Right, Mr. Honor Student.
Can you give Nunnally a message, tell her I’ll be late tonight?

Suzaku:
Did you say tonight? More like every night.
What’s the point in going to the same school if I never see you?
Aagh!

Lelouch: Hm? What’s going on?

Suzaku: Er, nothing! Err, hey, Arthur, ow ow!

Lelouch: I wonder what’s going on over there.

C.C.: So then it seems like…

Lelouch:
Right. It appears he doesn’t know about me.
That eliminates one group, the military.

C.C.: Aside from them and the Black Knights,
I can’t think of anyone else who would have been there.

Lelouch: Someone from the Japan Liberation Front could have survived.

C.C.: And they only stole your gun?

Lelouch: I think I’ll have Ohgi check out the black market then.

C.C.: And the blood?

Lelouch:
It’ll take time to analyze.
There’s something else…
I thought I saw Shirley there.

C.C.: Oh, the girl who kissed you?

Lelouch: Give it a rest, will you?

C.C.:
Just making sure I got the right girl, lover boy.
But if she was there, then there’s something we need to know and we better find out fast.

Darlton:
In this last operation and also at Narita, they were specifically targeting you, Your Highness.

Cornelia: Eliminating the leader is a standard tactic.

Guilford: They also eliminated Prince Clovis.

Darlton:
Zero was not merely fighting Britannia.
He has a deep hatred for the royal family, and he wants blood.

Euphemia: Hatred?

Lelouch:
Euphemia, you were willing to sacrifice yourself for the commoners.
You haven’t changed.

Cornelia: Careful, Euphy.

Euphemia: Huh?

Cornelia: I don’t want another crisis like that at the hotel.

Guilford: Why not assign a knight to her?

Euphemia: A knight?

Guilford:
Yes, if we assign one knight as a permanent sentinel, then we can build a complete royal guard unit around him.
As sub viceroy, Princess Euphemia has the right to a personal champion.

Cecile:
This thing about saving people’s lives… at first I thought he was just, you know, sensitive, but now, I mean it’s more like an obsession, isn’t it?

Lloyd:
His performance data is still solid, right?
Is this a good time to put that new thing to a test with him?

Cecile:
But we’re still fine-tuning.
What I’m saying is treating Suzaku like he’s just another part of the machine could have serious consequences.
We’d better deal with the human issue here first.

Lloyd: Pardon me, but really aren’t you taking care of him in place of someone else?

Cecile: I’m not sure about that, but…

Lloyd: Hmmm?

Cecile: You’re quick to catch on the something silly, aren’t you?

Lloyd: I’m the boss, so you’re stuck with me.

Girl Student1: Hey, what are you doing out here by yourself?

Girl Student2: I’m waiting. I need to wait till it finish disinfecting my room.

C.C.:
Why should I have to go rifling through some girl’s underwear.
This is going to cost you.

Lelouch: It always does.

C.C.:
Hmph, you could do this solo.
And she’d be thrilled to know the man she loves was searching through…

Lelouch: That’s my business.

C.C.:
Once again, making a big deal out of nothing.
Well there’s no sign of that gun in here.
And her diary only goes up to the 14th.

Lelouch: 14th?

C.C.: Yeah.

Lelouch: That’s the day that her father had died.
Uh… What?

C.C.: There are a bunch of photos of you.

Lelouch: Of me?

C.C.: How could our suspect be so sweet?

Lelouch: Just can the sarcasm, would you?
Narita?

Shirley: Lulu, how could you do this?

Mao: Yes. How could he?
A very fine memorial, isn’t that right, Ms. Shirley Fenette?

Shirley: Who…?

Tamaki: Man, it was so close! We had her right there!

Kallen: Next time, I’ll beat that white Knightmare.

Tamaki: Ah, don’t sweat it.

Black Knights: Yeah, Tamaki got thrashed in the first minute.

Ohgi: The J.L.F. warship…

Kallen: Hm?

Ohgi: Why did it blow up?

Tamaki: It self-destructed.

Ohgi: We did contact them and say we would help, right?

Tamaki:
Yo, that’s why Zero took action.
I know. They wanted to see his face!

Kallen: You’re not doubting Zero again, are you?

Ohgi: Well, it’s just that…

Diethald:
Yes, it’s just that the timing was too convenient, right?
So what are you going to do, if you find out Zero was behind it?

Kallen: What are you trying to say?!

Tamaki:
Yeah, Diethard! I heard you got wussy and ran away!
A gutless Brit’s got a lot of cojones talking trash to his superiors like that!

Diethald:
I was making an assessment, that’s my new job here.
Ohgi, you agreed to it, too, didn’t you?

Kallen: Oh, huh?

Ohgi: Ah, that’s right. And Zero did approve it.

C.C.: So, do you love her, this girl called Shirley?

Lelouch: Don’t know.

C.C.: Do you hate her?

Lelouch: Don’t know.

C.C.: Then why are we going to Narita?

Lelouch:
You know the reason why.
‘Cos she may have discovered who I am.

C.C.:
What if she really does know?
Are you going to kill her?
If you have someone you don’t want to lose, you should keep them at a distance.

Lelouch: So is that… from experience?

C.C.: No. It’s a way of life.

Mao: He’s a cruel man, isn’t he? Lelouch.

Shirley: H-How do you know about Lulu?

Mao: Oh, he deceived you. Never told you he’s Zero.

Shirley: Who are you? What do you want!?

Mao:
The same mouth that ordered your father’s death stole a kiss from your tender lips.
He’s a very bad man, and you like it.
Punishment must be measured out. To him. And to you.

Shirley: To me?!

Mao: I know everything. All that happened that night…

Villetta:
Is that Zero?!
Well, well, what a shocker.
The student is Zero himself!
A Britannian?

When I bring him to Viceroy Cornelia, she’ll make me a noble!
Not just a Knight of Honor, real nobility!
And he’s still alive, too!
What kind of grand execution will they have in store for him?
Of course you’ll be rewarded too…
Stupid of me… He’s your boyfriend, isn’t he?!

Shirley: Lulu!

Mao: So you’re a killer, too. Just like Zero.

Shirley: No! That’s not true! I just…

Mao: And you actually used your father’s death for your own gain!

Shirley: No! I just… I just!!!

Mao: Cunning little woman!
You knew he’d feel sorry for you, didn’t you?
So you played it for all it was worth.

Shirley: No, you’re wrong!

Mao: Did his sympathy make you all tingly?

Shirley: Stop it!

Mao: Play the tragic heroine again?

Shirley: No, I’m not doing that!

Mao: A girl who kills and then goes fishing for attention?
Only evil witches do that.

Shirley: I didn’t… I never meant…

Mao:
You knew there was another girl who liked Lelouch,
and you wanted to get him away from her.
Now you have to pay the price, Shirley.

Do you want to carry these feelings around for the rest of your life? All by yourself?
Unless you atone and completely free your heart,
you and Lelouch will both be lost in your sins… forever.

Lelouch: I thought she’d be here.

C.C.: We’ll have to split up and look for her.

Lelouch: Do you even know what Shirley looks like?

C.C.: What’s with you now?

Lelouch: The chance is so slim. I doubt she’s even here.

C.C.: What if she really does know? Are you going to kill her?

Lelouch:
No, wait. There was someone else here.
Where’d they go?
And what were they doing with Shirley?
Calm down. Work from the beginning.

Pi–Pi-Pi-Pi-Pi-Pi

It’s Shirley?!
I’m here. Where are you calling from?

Mao: Haha, where indeed?

Lelouch:
Who are you?!
You scum! What have you done with Shirley?

Mao:
Ooh, I like it, the scary face.
The face of a man whose woman was stolen away.

Lelouch: What the hell did you do with her?!

Mao:
You want to know?
Then you’ll have to accept my challenge.
You specialize in this, don’t you?

C.C.:
Are you familiar with Balinese art?
I don’t have a photo, but I can paint it in Batuan style.

Man:
What, I’m supposed to wait around here while you do that?
I don’t think so.
Why don’t you go ask the police or the soldiers?

C.C.: I’d like to avoid that kind of dull crisis.

Man: Then why don’t you climb up on something tall and look around?

C.C.:　Very well. Never mind.
Hmm?　What’s Lelouch up to?
It can’t be…. Mao!

Lelouch:
Is he the one?
Or other eyewitness?
I’m sure this chess game is just a ploy.
His real goal is to lure me to an isolated place.

Mao: You know I’ve never actually played this game before, don’t you?

Lelouch:
Calling on my mobile… was he just being theatrical?
No, he didn’t know what I look like.
That means he didn’t see me that night. And he didn’t have time to find a photo of me.
He hasn’t planned this out, he’s winging it. Which means…

Mao:
There’s an opening you can use?
Shouldn’t you be thinking about the game a bit more?
You could lose.

Lelouch:
You liar, you have played this game before!

C.C.:
Lelouch, even you…
No, because it’s you, you can never beat Mao.

Lelouch: Impossible… He’s got me trapped?!

Mao: So, can we just call it my game, hmm?

Lelouch:
How could he predict every move I made?
Who is this guy?!

Mao:
Didn’t C.C. tell you about me?
Well done! In one lightning moment, you came up with 14 possible identities for me.
And one of them is precisely correct.

Lelouch: He has Geass, too!

Mao:
Let’s see now. For your Geass, you have to look directly into someone’s eyes.
Oh, I know all the rules for your little gift.

Lelouch: You can read minds!

Mao: You could call my Geass mind-reading.

Lelouch:
What the hell did you do to Shirley?!
Tell me! What did you do, kill her?!

Mao: Of course not!

Lelouch: It’s Shirley!

Mao: So now then, let the vital punishment games begin.

Ohgi:
Zero… You weren’t yourself yesterday.
Why do I have this feeling?
Are you all right?
Talk to me, hey, come on.
You’re alive.

Villetta: So, it’s you, Zero…!

Lelouch: Shirley, that gun is…

Shirley: Yes, it’s Zero’s, your gun, Lulu…

Mao:
Why don’t you use your Geass?
I’m pretty sure you haven’t used it on her, right?
Of course, if you do, I’ll just shoot you myself.

Lelouch:
Can he read any thoughts, or only those on the surface?
Are there conditions to his Geass, a time lag, time limit?
And what’s he after?
If he plans to kill me, then…

Mao:
Keep thinking about it.
That’s your strong point, right?
Thoughts spinning round and round and round…

Lelouch: Shut up!

Mao: This is a fitting death, poetic justice for a thief like you.

Shirley:
Lulu… die.
We’ll atone for our sins…
We have to! I’ll die with you.

Lelouch: What?

Mao:
She’s already killed one time.
She shot the person who saw your face, all to protect your little secret.

Lelouch: Then, that blood was…

Shirley: It’s time to end this together, Lulu.

Mao: Yes, yes. Sinners must be punished.

Lelouch:
You put her up to all of this!
I see. He reads mind and it’s easy for him to confuse and control her!

Mao: Yes, that’s right.

Lelouch:
No, don’t let him trick you!
Shirley, he’s just…

Mao:
Come now, are you actually saying this?
The guy who lied to her from the start?

Shirley: No, stop it!

Lelouch: If murder is a sin, then this absolutely increases the sin!

Mao: Oh, I like the rhetoric, very pithy.

Lelouch:
Shirley, did you really kill somebody?
And if you did kill, was he the one who was controlling you?

Mao:
Shirley pulled the trigger and she knows it.
When you hide away your sins, it only gets worse.

Lelouch: He’s trying to confuse you, Shirley!

Shirley: Why don’t you shut up?!

Mao:
What are you hesitating for?
He’s the one who killed your father.
Don’t you know he’s a sinner? Kill him now.

Shirley: But…

Lelouch: Shirley…

Shirley: I just… I don’t…

Mao:
What the heck’s up with this girl?
Her thoughts are just a jumble now.
I’ll just have to do it–

Shirley: Stop it! Just stop it!

Mao:
Fine. Consider it stopped.
You two just do whatever as you want.

Shirley: Huh…

Lelouch: Shirley!

Mao:
What a pain. It was so dramatic and juicy.
Now I’ll have to kill them in the old boring way.
Who did that?
Why didn’t I sense them there?
It couldn’t be!
C.C.!

I just knew it!
We finally meet again.
It’s you! It’s really you!

C.C.:
Are you awake, Mao?
Forgive me, Mao.
That’s the way. See, Mao? You can do it!
Thank you, Mao.

Mao:
You look beautiful, C.C.! I love that new look!
C.C., I’ll come to see you as soon as I can!
I promise! I promise!

C.C.: Mao…
I never thought you would come out among people.

Lelouch: It’s all right now. It’s over.

Shirley: Lulu, I really did kill someone…
That’s why I’m…

Lelouch: It’s because of me. It’s not your fault.

Shirley: And I shot you with your gun…

Lelouch: I’m still alive.

Shirley: But! I did it!

Lelouch: Shirley, any sin you committed is mine to bear.

Shirley: I wanted you to be kind to me.

Lelouch: What’s wrong with that?

Shirley: Even though my father died….

Lelouch: Don’t worry. It’s time to forget all the bad things that have happened to you.

Shirley: But I can’t!

Lelouch: Yes, you can! I’ll help you forget all of this.

Shirley: Impossible.

Lelouch:
Shirley, I’m sorry about your father.
If I could be reborn into a new life, I would…

Shirley: Lulu… No, don’t!

Shirley: Oh, hello.
Um, did you lose someone in your family, too?

Lelouch:
No, not someone from my family.
It was a friend, someone, well, very important.

Shirley: I understand.

Lelouch:
But I didn’t know.
I didn’t know until after I lost her.
Then I realized how much she meant to me…
How her smile saved me.
And how I’ll never be able to argue or laugh with her like that again.

Shirley: I see.
You loved her, didn’t you?
You must feel terrible.

Lelouch: Right now… I don’t know anymore.

Shirley: Well, the morning always comes again.

Lelouch: What?

Shirley:
I have to say it’s funny.
I know that I came out here for some reason, but I can’t remember exactly what it was now.
Maybe it’s because I already put the whole thing behind me, something I wanted to let go of.
Maybe it was something I thought I couldn’t forget.
Maybe I was full of sadness.
But morning still comes, right?
That’s why you shouldn’t try to hold back your thoughts like that.

Lelouch:
Yes, you’re right. I feel the same way now.
Thanks a lot for everything.

Shirley: Huh?

Lelouch:
All right. First I just wanna confirm this.
Are you my enemy or my ally?

C.C.: Where’s this coming from?

Lelouch:
Mao’s geass lets him give right in the someone’s head and hear what he was thinking and planning.
I’ve got that right, don’t I?

C.C.:
Yes, the way Geass manifests is different for each person.
If Mao concentrates, he can hear thoughts up to 500 meters away
and he can read clear down to your subconscious if he wants to.
For someone like you, who fights for his head, he’s the worst possible enemy.

Lelouch:
500 meters… Well it doesn’t really come as a surprise to me.
I knew there must be others who have the power of Geass.
Did you make a contract with him?

C.C.: 11 years ago.

Lelouch:
So he’s my predecessor.
Is there some reason that this forerunner is also my enemy?

C.C.:
Mao’s after me.
He may be your enemy, but he’s not targeting you.

Lelouch:
Yeah, well, I can see that.
He could have reveal my true identity and told the police or the military who I am,
but the only one he told was Shirley.
Are there limits to his powers?

C.C.:
Mao’s geass is very potent.
He can use it as many times as he wants and he doesn’t need direct eye contact like you do.

Lelouch: Does he have any weaknesses?

C.C.:
If you press me, I guess it’s that he can’t turn his power off.
In a crowd he hears all the minds roiling and writhing around him, whether he wants to or not.

C.C.:
Don’t worry Mao. I’m not going to die.
Mao! Mao! Are you awake Mao?
Oh Mao, How silly …

Mao: C.C. I can’t live without you. Wait for me. I’m coming to you.

Lelouch: If Mao read my mind, then he already knows my weak points and that’s where he’ll strike.

Nunnally: It’s been a long time since we spent time by ourselves huh?

Lelouch: You know even Sayoko needs a little time off now and again.
Starting today, I’ll be staying home for a while.

Nunnally: Lately, you’ve been out of the house so much I was curious.
Have you found some really fun game to play or something?

Lelouch: Sort of. My current opponent is pretty hard to beat.

Nunnally: That’s funny. Only our big brother Schneizel, would ever make you say something like that.

Man:
Sorry, but I can’t sell you one without a permit.
It’s illegal. Besides, you’re from the Chinese Federation, aren’t you?

Mao:
Ah.. true. But you sell them to the Black Knights last Tuesday 2300 hours.
Your contact was named Wolf, an alias, of course.

Man: Who are you?

Mao: You will kindly accommodate me, won’t you now?

Lelouch: And?

C.C.: I know that you want to protect your sister and all,
but you can’t just sit around here and wait for him.

Lelouch: I’ve got the Black Knights hunting for him.

C.C.:
What if he’s not in the ghetto like you think?
What if he’s right here in the Tokyo settlement?
Then you’ve wasted all that precious time.
You could just use me as bait.
I’m Mao’s target, so I should be…

Lelouch: Tell me, if I keep using my Geass, will I become like him?
Or did he end up the way he is because he didn’t fulfill his contract with you?

C.C.: The more you use your Geass, the more powerful it becomes.
Those who cannot control the power are ultimately ravaged and consumed by it.

Lelouch: And even though you know everything about that, you still offered these contracts? To me, and Mao?

C.C.: That’s right.

Lelouch: You’re a cruel girl.
I don’t know why anyone would chase after you.
Mao couldn’t fulfill his contract with you, so you cut him loose.
What were the terms of the contract?

You’re a monster.
Why didn’t you finish him when you cut him off.
You should’ve taken his power back, or taken his life.
Because you left things half-finished, Shirley was…

C.C.: We should split up while we’re dealing with Mao.
Starting today, I’ll stay in the next hall.

Lelouch: You can’t.
The student council and the cultural clubs meet there.

C.C.: I don’t care about that. You work it out.

Suzaku: A medical checkup?

Cecile: Just regulations. It’s required for all Knightmare pilots.

Suzaku: I understand.

Cecile: Good, tomorrow then, after your school gets out.

Suzaku: Right, thanks. Oh, Miss Cecile, do you know of any way I can get in to see princess Euphemia?

Cecile: Huh? You want to meet her?

Lloyd: Forget it, You have to be at least a Knight of Honor to get an audience with her.

Cecile: But an earl could arrange it, if you really want it to.

Lloyd: Who? me?

Cecile: Yes!

Suzaku: Huh? Lloyd! You are an earl? You never told me that.

Lloyd: Ha-ha, Oh, I’m so embarrassed.

Cecile: The prodigal son of nobles. He can’t really separate work from play.
Suzaku: Wow…

Lelouch: You know, It will just be for a few days.
If you can keep the club house off limits. That would really help out.

Milly: Well, It’s not like I can’t do it.
but… Say, did someone find out you’re a prince?

Lelouch: Hopefully, that secret is still safe.
Only the Ashford family knows that I’m still here and still alive.

Milly: The all-knowing Ashfords.

Lelouch: Is something wrong?

Milly: Oh Lelouch, they’ve got another blind date set up for me.
I may not be able to wriggle out of this one.
What do you think I should do about it?

Lelouch: Well, that is…

Shirley: Madam President!

Milly: Shirley, were you back at morning practice?

Shirley: Yeah, just started again today. It can’t stay sad forever.

Milly: I should take lessons from you on positive thinking.

Shirley: What are you talking about?
You are way more…
Huh? Are you the boy from…?
Did you go to school here, too?

Milly: Are you putting me on!?

Lelouch: We’re in the same classes.

Shirley: Huh? No, I don’t think we are! Huh… Are we?

Lelouch: Please, that’s enough now.

Girls: Shirley, we’re ready to start.

Shirley: I’ll be right there. See you later, prez.

Milly: What was that about?

Lelouch: We… had a little fight.

Milly: So, she is kind strangers? Oh, that is so cute.

Lelouch: Sorry, but could you play along with us till she gets over it, you know?

Milly: I guess I could. Think it’ll take long?

Lelouch: Yes, I’m afraid so.

C.C.: I’m not looking for a Refrain dealer.
I said a Chinese guy named Mao. Did you here me?

Man:
Believe me, I have no idea. The only Chinese around xxx push xxx is gang labor
Go ask cops or something.

C.C.: I don’t like cops.

Man:
Then ask the Black Knights about him.
They’are all of the underworld. They wire into the settlement and the ghettos.

C.C.: Everyone tells me the same thing.

Man: ‘Cause it’s obvious.

Shirley: Huh? That’s strange. Where is it?

Girl: What’s matter, Shirley? What are you looking for?

Shirley: My diary. It’s gone. I can’t find it anywhere. Hah, Did you take it somewhere?

Girl : Of course not.

Inoue: Right, I’m sorry, Zero. We haven’t found this Mao guy yet.

Lelouch: I see.

Inoue: Should we check our contacts in the Kyoto network?

Lelouch: No, just stay with Kanto block. If you come up any leads, let me know.

Inoue: Yes, we’ll do.

Lelouch:
All right. I’ll get back to you.
If I get within 500 meters of Mao, he can read my mind. That’s what he wants.
But knowing that, I should be able to guess his next move.
I could put him in check if I had just one…

C.C.: Missing piece?
You and I are thinking exactly the same thing.

Lelouch: So it seems…

C.C.: Then we should work together on this, don’t you agree?

Lelouch: I do.

RRRRRRRRR

Lelouch: Yes?

Mao: It’s me, Lulu.
C.C.’s there, too, isn’t she?
I wanna talk to her alone. Put her on.

Villetta: Ah…

Ohgi: Are you waking up now?

Villetta: Yes…

Ohgi: What were you doing in that place, passed out like that?
What you’re name?

Villetta: I am… My name is.. What is my name…?

Ohgi: You don’t remember? What about Zero? You are talking about him before?

Villetta: Who’s Zero?

Ohgi: Ah… What am I doing? I practically betray him and why…

Villetta: But I don’t know anything. Oh, nothing at all.

Ohgi: Sorry I was able to undress you with my eye closed. But getting clothes back on wasn’t so… But I turned up heat, so I thought you’d be all right.

Villetta: Hmm. Thank goodness.

Ohgi: Ah…?

Villetta: Anyone could have picked me up out there, but I got someone nice.

Ohgi: Hah…?

C.C.:
You should be happy about this, Lelouch.
We’re finally going our separate ways.
I made up with Mao.

Lelouch: You’re betraying me?

C.C.:
Are you actually saying that?
When were you my friend? Never.
We were just co-conspirators, that’s all.

Lelouch: Wait.

C.C.:
Wow, here’s a surprise.
You sound just like Mao.

Lelouch:
C.C., you know way too much about me now.
I can’t let you walk away like this.
Don’t go! C.C., stay here with me!

C.C.:
Geass does not work on me.
Didn’t I mention that?
Don’t worry. I won’t tell anyone about you.
You can keep your Geass, too.
And Mao won’t bother you anymore.
He’ll never cross your path.
So all your obstacles are gone.
Congratulations and farewell.

Doctor:
The test results came out fine, though you seems to pay extreme attention to discipline and to weighing the value of human life.

Suzaku: Is that going to cause problems?

Doctor:
These are the positive traits for a soldier.
Do you think subconsciously you are comparing yourself to your father?
That may be the underlying cause of your insecurity. It’s quite common in the children of famous people. Your father Genbu Kururugi, the former prime minister of Japan. He was a great man.

Chiba: Urabe and others are late.

Asahina: Well this sure is an ironic meeting place, isn’t it? The grave of Prime Minister Kururugi?

Chiba: The traitor who told us to fight to the end, then commit suicide himself.

Todo: Enough! General Katase also committed suicide and he was a true patriot.

Britannia force:
Fugitive Todo, identified. All unit, prepared to move in.
Yes, my load.

Lelouch:
Yes, I’ve read through your proposal for reorganizing the Black Knights.
I’ve got a few changes, but overall I like where you’re going with this. I’ll run it by Ohgi tomorrow.

Diethald: Thanks. I appreciate that.

Lelouch:
Next draft, I’d like you to insert a chart that forecasts how the cells-base structure will be implemented. That’s all.

Diethald:
So that was the final test. I guess I passed.

Lelouch:
Diethald, though he’s Britannian, he’s proving even more useful than I’d hoped.
Still he could be a spy. I can’t rule that out yet.
Um.. Right, he recorded it then.

Mao:
C.C., your mind is so quiet.
It’s the only one I can’t read.
You really are the best there is!

C.C.:As childish as ever, I see.

Mao: I’m a prince on a white stallion, and a prince has to rescue the princess.
Does that make you happy, C.C.?

C.C.: Mao, we talked about this before.
I told you that you and I…

Mao: Those were all lies. Lies.
C.C., you love me and this is how I know.

C.C.: Thank you, Mao. Mao, Mao.
Stop it.

Mao: Be quiet.

C.C.:
Don’t listen to them.
Just listen to the sound of my voice.
That’s it.
Since my mind is the only one you can’t read, and you can only be happy when you’re with me.
I’ll stay with you always.
Yes, I’m right here.
So you don’t need to worry.

Mao:
C.C., you’re the only one! The only one I want forever.
Lelouch doesn’t matter at all.
If you just come with me…

C.C.: Stop it! I should’ve done this a long long time ago.

Mao: It’s me C.C.

C.C.: Mao.

Mao:
I’ll be at Clovis Land.
Come alone.

C.C.: You’re selfish as ever, I see.

Mao:
If you don’t come, I’ll just have to tell the police who Lelouch really is.
I can have him eliminated anytime I want.

C.C.:
You should be happy about this, Lelouch.
We’re finally going our separate ways.

Lelouch:
She comes and goes like the wind.
I can’t read her.
I can’t fathom how such a twisted girl thinks. Idiot!

Mao:
I knew it. I knew you couldn’t pull the trigger.
That’s ’cause you really love me, C.C!

C.C.:
You’re wrong!
I was just using you right from the start.

Mao:
What are you saying?
You shouldn’t tell lies like that. You really shouldn’t.
Lies are very very wicked. Wicked lies!

Don’t worry… I understand…
C.C. you must listen to me.
I’ve build a big brand-new house in Australia, a very quiet, white, immaculate special house.
But to get to Australia, you’ll need to take in airplane and there isn’t very much room.
The thing is, C.C., you’re a little too big to bring on a plane.
So that’s why…, I’m going to make you compact. It’ll take little time at all.

C.C.:
Is this your revenge?
You’re punishing me?

Mao:
Oh, no, I’m not.
I’m not, I’m not, I’m not at all.
I’m showing you my gratitude.

Lelouch:
So this is the place that you picked.
A place where there’d be no one else’s thoughts to bother you.
That narrowed it way down.

Mao: Lelouch

Lelouch:
Since your Geass has the total maximum range of 500 meters.
It can’t reach me here at Tokyo Tower.

Mao:
That’s true. That’s very true.
But what can you do from so far away, hmm?
After taking all that trouble to hack into the system, what’s your grand plan?
A remote-control attack with some battery-operated toys, or a tongue-lashing to lecture me into submission?
Ah, cat got your tongue now?
If you want C.C., then you’re gonna have to come …

Lelouch:
Mao, think! You don’t believe C.C. is her real name, do you?
She never even whispers it to anyone.

Mao: Huh?

Lelouch:
But I know it, though. She told me her true name.

Mao:
Is that right, C.C.?
You never told me, ever ever.
But you told it to him?

Lelouch:
You know why?
Because C.C. is mine.
C.C. belongs to me in every possible way.

Mao:
No. She doesn’t. She doesn’t. She doesn’t. She doesn’t.
She was mine long before she met you.

Lelouch:
I have gained every single thing from her, including all of the part that you have never seen,
all of them…

Mao:
Lelouch…
Face me!
Lelouch, Come here. Come here.
I can look into your mind.
I’ll see the truth. I’ll see what a liar you are. Liar.

Lelouch: Mao, you’ve lost.

Mao:
What are you talking about?
I won’t care . I’m gonna be with C.C.

Is that Lelouch? But he’s too far away.
Sounds… everywhere… all those voices.

Police: Hold it right there. Drop the weapon and surrender!

Mao: What are they doing here?

Police: Remain where you are! Drop out your weapon and raise your hands.

Mao: It’s the police. Who contacted them?

C.C.: Lelouch, what are you doing here?

Mao: It can’t be.
He was just at Tokyo tower. He can’t be here now.

Lelouch:
Are you that slow?
That was all a recording.

Mao: That’s a lie.
You, you were talking to me, answering me.

Lelouch:
Your thoughts are simple.
Since you read minds, you’ve never resorted to cunning.

Mao:
You predicted every one of answers?
Don’t play game with me, punk!
If the cop arrests me, I’ll be back out in a heartbeat!

Mao: Shut up. Just stop talking me!

Lelouch:
C.C. told me you can’t turn off your Geass.
And your reach is erratic.
If you don’t concentrate, your range gets very short.

Mao:
So do you used the monitor to keep me distracted?
Even so, I can still defeat you.
I’ll have you ruined.

Lelouch: The moment you try is the moment you die.

C.C.:
Lelouch, wait.
If I talk to him. I can get through.

Mao:
You think I’ll die?
Listen, cops. You know who that guy is?
He’s the terrorist you want. He….

Police: Fire!!

C.C: Oh, Mao…

Mao: Zero…

C.C.:
Mao was only six years old when I made my contract with him.
He was an orphan who’d never known the love of the parent.
He couldn’t read or write and knew nothing of good and evil.

Police:
This is Echo-3.
I’ve released the hostage into the ghetto as ordered.

What?
Your orders were to take her into the hospital.

C.C.:
When I gave the geass power to Mao, it isolated him.
In his mind, I became his only friend and his lover, though I was still a perfect stranger.
I’m the only one he even thought of as human.
I was Mao’s entire world.

Lelouch:
C.C., listen to me.
I won’t let Geass destroy me.
And I will conquer its power and bend it to my will, and use it to change the world.
I’ll fulfill your desire and my own.
Then I will complete the contract that he couldn’t achieve.
So please…

C.C.:
Lelouch, tell me.
Are you trying to comfort me? Pity me?
Or is this part of your obsession?

Lelouch:
It’s a contract.
This time, it’s from me to you.

C.C.: Very well then. I accept your contract.
